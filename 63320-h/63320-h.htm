<h2 class="nobreak">
<span class="smcap">Chapter I</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">A LETTER HOME</span></h2>



<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Palace, St. Petersburg.</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">MY Dear Miller</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>Your letter, which was as short as old Canfield&#8217;s
temper, reached me in Berlin as I was starting
for here. I&#8217;m off to Khiva, this wise.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll remember my old yarn about the Czar having
saved my life years ago in a pig-sticking do in Germany&mdash;he
shoved or kicked me into a bush just in
the nick of time when the brute made his rush&mdash;and
how we then discovered the strong resemblance between
us? Well, it&#8217;s still true, and things have been
happening in consequence.</p>

<p>I ran across Burnaby&#8217;s book about Khiva a while
back and resolved to go there. He says that three
Tartars can eat a whole sheep at a single meal, and
I want to see if it&#8217;s true. Any old tag&#8217;s good enough
excuse for a globe-trotter, so I wrote to the Czar,
reminded him of the pig incident, and asked permission
to go East. As a result, I&#8217;m here as his guest;
we&#8217;ve had a chat over the old time, and I&#8217;m to go
where, when and how I like all over his dominions.
He&#8217;s an awfully decent sort, and I&#8217;m in for a real
good time. But it&#8217;s been a queer show.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a woman in it of course&mdash;and a glorious
woman too. A tall, queenly creature, as handsome
as a Greek, with the free carriage of one of our own
American girls. I saw her on the train, or rather she
saw me and seemed particularly interested in me, and
it was suiting me very nicely when out came the reason.
We stopped at a station some miles from the capital,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
and as the girl and I were separated from the rest of
the people, she said in an undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty does not count the risks of travelling
incognito, alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are pleasures to counterbalance any risks,
mademoiselle,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Your solicitude is one
of them.&#8221; And I smiled, partly at her amazing mistake
and partly because she was so pretty. Then to
put myself right, I added: &#8220;But you mistake, I am
no Majesty. I am an American, Harper C. Denver is
my name.&#8221; She lifted her eyebrows and smiled again,
in obvious disbelief, and replied in French&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American who understands Russian, speaks
French, and resembles His Majesty the Czar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American who would gladly welcome an opportunity
of seeing you again, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American who does not desire it more fervently
than I. Meanwhile, accept my warning, sire.&#8221; She
spoke with intense earnestness, and then left the train.</p>

<p>How&#8217;s that for an adventure, eh? But that was
only scene one. I sat thinking it over until the train
ran into the station at Petersburg, and then came scene
two.</p>

<p>The moment I stepped from the cars I saw that considerable
preparations had been made to receive some
one of importance, and while I stood looking about for
him an old man, tightly bound in a somewhat rich
uniform, with two or three companion volumes in attendance
and a shelf of soldiers behind, came up to me.
He waved everybody else out of earshot, and then with
an almost reverential salute, said, in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Denver, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me to welcome you to the capital in my
august master&#8217;s name. I am Prince Kalkov, and His
Majesty has instructed me to conduct you to the Palace.
Will you accompany me?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the people on the platform had begun
to show considerable interest in the proceedings, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
my intense amusement, and came crowding around a
bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted,&#8221; I replied; and accordingly
the Prince gave a word of command to those in attendance,
a guard of soldiers was formed, and I was in
this way escorted to the first of a string of carriages
in waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Palace at full gallop,&#8221; cried the Prince in
a tone loud enough to reach the by-standers. Some
one raised a shout of &#8220;God save the Emperor,&#8221; and in
another minute we were off to the accompaniment of
loud cries and ringing cheers from the crowd, which
was by that time a pretty big one.</p>

<p>That was my sensational entrance into the capital.
Here I am at the Czar&#8217;s Palace, and from what I can
judge there&#8217;s a great deal more of the same kind to
follow.</p>

<div class="verse">And the same I shall hope to explain&#8221;&mdash;another time.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Comic opera with a dash of mysticism seems about
a fair description of things up to now. More, when
I&#8217;ve time to write.</p>

<p>By the way, couldn&#8217;t you manage to leave Wall
Street and the dollar raking process for a while and
meet me on my return? I mean to go on from
Khiva through India to China. Come and lunch with
me, say in Pekin, and have a time among the pigtails.
Wire me at our Legation and our people will forward
to me. Seriously, you might do many things worse.
Your old friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Harper C. Denver.</span></p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;I&#8217;m not monkeying about the Pekin business.
Come and meet me like the good fellow you
are, and hang Wall Street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
<span class="smcap">Chapter II</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">PRINCE KALKOV&#8217;S
PROPOSITION</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YOU mean seriously that I am to impersonate
His Majesty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For this purpose, M. Denver, that is my serious
meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a most extraordinary proposition.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The occasion itself is quite an extraordinary one,
of course. But I repeat, you will be doing His
Majesty and his Ministers a service of extreme importance.
I have asked you, of course, as I said
before, only because I understand you deem yourself
under a deep obligation to my master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard us speaking to-night of the incident.
I owe him probably my life, and certainly an escape
from serious injuries. We Americans don&#8217;t go back
on a call, and I admit it&#8217;s up to him to call now.
But this is such an odd thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think it over. It is a national characteristic of
your countrymen to be prompt. Shall I return, say,
in an hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Prince,&#8221; I said as he rose, and
pushing my chair back I took a few turns up and
down the room.</p>

<p>We were in the apartments which had been assigned
to me in the Palace, and the Prince had interrupted
me as I was planning out my projected journey to
Khiva. It was nearly midnight, and my maps and
papers lay open on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite at your disposal, M. Denver,&#8221; he
replied courteously as he resumed his chair and
watched me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>&#8220;Let me see that I&#8217;ve got the hang of the thing
right,&#8221; I said after a while. &#8220;You say this man,
Boreski, is really dangerous; but I thought you had
a quick method of dealing with dangerous men in
Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a case for ordinary methods, M. Denver,
or I should not have come to you. I wish to
deal with you with complete frankness, and have
spoken unreservedly as to a personal friend of my
master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t pull very far together if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be candid, I am not sure what the man&#8217;s
secret object is&mdash;presuming, that is, he has one. We
know little of him beyond the fact that he is an adventurer
and a musician of exceptional brilliance,
and that the Duchess Stephanie has conceived a
great&mdash;I suppose, I should say&mdash;fondness for him.
She declares she will marry him&mdash;in defiance of the
Emperor&#8217;s prohibition: a marriage of the kind being
outside the pale of possibility, of course, owing to
her relationship to the Imperial Family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he&#8217;s after her money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other conclusion can one draw? The
Duchess is twenty years older than he; she is the
reverse of prepossessing in appearance; and he is
young, handsome and certainly clever. Apart from
other reasons the marriage would be a tragedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then there are these papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then there are these papers, as you say.
She is entirely dominated by him, and there is no
doubt she acted at his instigation and&mdash;well, purloined
them and carried them to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is certainly a daring fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A daring scoundrel, unquestionably,&#8221; assented the
Prince, accenting the &#8220;scoundrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But knowing this, why not have arrested him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I had made that clear. I tried it, but
he met me too cleverly. Indeed, I believe he actually
angled for the arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>&#8220;Angled for it. How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he might get face to face with me and let
me realize how far he could go, and would if pressed.
It was then he told me of these papers, and that he
had placed them in reliable hands to be given, if he
were detained, to those who must of course never
see them. Never, at any cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled at the frank avowal.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very awkward, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might mean even war with the Powers
chiefly concerned. They are extremely confidential
documents. You understand, of course, M. Denver,
that in diplomacy, any more than in poker, we cannot
always lay the cards on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a fine bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too dangerous for me to see him,&#8221; returned the
Prince with a smile, falling readily into the language
of the pool room. &#8220;And the worst of it was he knew
it and claimed the jack pot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a smart man. And his terms are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Preposterous, absolutely; monstrous. The Imperial
consent to his marriage; a special dowry of
a million roubles; a patent of nobility; and a private
interview with His Majesty. It was then I thought
of you, His Majesty having told me you were coming
here, and that you bore so striking a resemblance to
him. I arranged the scene at the station this evening
to test that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you wish me to go to this interview, fool the
man, and get the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. Counting upon your obligation to the
Emperor, I have indeed fixed the interview for to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce you have. Isn&#8217;t that rather sharp
work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter does not admit of delay; but it is
of course open to you to decline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In which case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet considered any alternative.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>His coolness staggered me. But he was keen
enough to see that I rather enjoyed the prospect of
the adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now as to the risks?&#8221; I asked after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot even pretend to gauge them, M. Denver.
I don&#8217;t think they should be considerable; but there
is naturally the chance that the deception would be
discovered. I don&#8217;t think it is probable. Those who
are constantly with His Majesty would know you in
a moment of course; but these people only see my
master on public occasions, and, as you have had evidence,
are quite ready to be deceived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the risk is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unquestionably,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;The incident with
the lady in the train which you described is, however,
very promising. Still, as you say, the risk is there, and
it is enough to make any ordinary man unwilling to
run it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You flatter me, Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I try to judge you. An ordinary man would
not be eager to rush off to Khiva. Besides, you are
an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>The appeal to my vanity was put astutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were discovered I should have to get out the
best way I could?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There might be some little trouble, but I don&#8217;t
think it would be really serious&mdash;to a man of resource,
that is. You would be quite authorized to
put the blame on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if the deception were not discovered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a short interview, and you would
at the worst have to postpone your departure for one
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t anticipate any treachery? No assassination
business, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boreski has too much at stake. He would lose
everything&mdash;including his worthless life, of course.
About the strongest guarantee for your safety that
you could have.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>He put the amazing proposal bluntly and argued
the case with as much coolness as if it had been little
more than a simple conventional matter of almost
everyday routine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would naturally like to think it over,&#8221; he
said, after I had paced the room a while in thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have told me everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so, except, perhaps, that, of course,
I don&#8217;t for a moment believe Boreski made the proposition
seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it&#8217;s an odd sort of joke, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that. I mean that no man in his
senses would believe the Emperor would consent to
his conditions for the interview&mdash;that my master
should go to it absolutely unattended, that the place
should be determined by Boreski and known to him
alone, and that my master should meet a lady at the
railway station, get into a strange carriage with her
and be taken wherever they pleased to take him.
Even in democratic countries monarchs don&#8217;t act like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what do you mean?&#8221; I asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That he intended to have his terms rejected in
order that he might use the rejection to raise them.
When I agreed&mdash;I only did so with you in my
thoughts&mdash;I saw that his surprise amounted almost
to embarrassment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this woman in it then, beside the Duchess
Stephanie? Who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t an idea&mdash;some accomplice no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the conditions are, as you say, so ridiculous,
may he not be suspicious when we agree to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very possible. But on the other hand he
knows that my master is as anxious as I am about
those papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he may think the Emperor would take the
risk. I see. Well, I guess I&#8217;ll do it, Prince, but I
should like to think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Kalkov rose at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>&#8220;Naturally. I need only say, monsieur, that you
will be doing His Majesty and Russia a service which
we shall not forget. Shall I have your decision in
the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night, if you&#8217;ll come back, say, in a couple of
hours. You won&#8217;t find me asleep after all you&#8217;ve
said.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled pleasantly, and as he went to the door,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are just the man I would have chosen for
such a task, M. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;but there&#8217;s
just one more question, by the by. Which are the
countries concerned in those papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and gave me a sharp swift look, which
broke to a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the United States, monsieur, but European
Powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the assurance I wished,&#8221; said I, and then
he went.</p>

<p>I had virtually made up my mind before the Prince
left the room, and save for one consideration I should
have consented right away. But I could not quite size
up the Prince himself.</p>

<p>I was almost British in my distrust of certain classes
of Russian officials. I had lived in Petersburg for
some years as a boy, and my father, who was at the
Embassy, had inculcated this prejudice.</p>

<p>I could never resist the feeling that they had some
subtle undercurrent motive which made for duplicity;
and I could not now shake myself free from the belief
in regard to Prince Kalkov.</p>

<p>I had no tangible reason for it. He stood high in
the confidence of the Czar; he had gone out of his
way to make himself agreeable to me; he had treated
me apparently with signal frankness; and had admitted
the possible risks and complications of the
very tangled business.</p>

<p>I had another slight qualm. My sympathies were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
rather with than against the man Boreski. I was not
a Russian aristocrat; and from my American point
of view I was disposed to admire the pluck of a man
who was fighting single-handed against the powerful
Russian Court, and giving that autocratic body a real
bad time. His methods were not nice, but his adroit
use of them was so smart that I could not help enjoying
them. Whereas, if it came to a mere question of
ethics, I couldn&#8217;t see that, taking into account the
shady episode of the secret papers, either side had much
pull over the other.</p>

<p>What really decided me was my old obligation to
the Czar. My inclinations were all on the side of
going in for the thing; and probably I gave more
weight to that consideration than it deserved. But
anyway I convinced myself that I could wipe out the
old debt by doing what was asked of me, and when
the Prince came back, I met him with the statement
that if the details of the thing could be fixed, I was
his man.</p>

<p>He was manifestly delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you what pleasure your decision
gives me. We shall now circumvent him completely.
This is Boreski,&#8221; and he handed me a photograph.</p>

<p>The man was certainly handsome and distinguished-looking.
Dark as a raven, with large, deep-set,
thoughtful eyes under straight brows, a broad ample
forehead, straight nose, very shapely mouth with
curved mobile lips, and a narrowing chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;A handsome fellow, and that&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the Duchess thinks,&#8221; he returned drily, handing
me her portrait.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said she was twenty years his senior. This
is a young woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was taken last year: a Court photograph,&#8221; and
he smiled. &#8220;She&#8217;s all but fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love at fifty may be a very serious passion, Prince.
Have you no scruples about blighting it? She might
take it badly and pine away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>&#8220;She might do much worse, monsieur, and marry
that rascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her fortune is her own, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would forfeit much of it if she married without
the Emperor&#8217;s consent. Boreski knows that well
enough, and trades on it. I do not think we shall find
him a really strong man. He has the whip hand of
us for the moment through those stolen documents;
but when we once get those, we shall be able to frighten
him, I am convinced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought I not to know the nature of the documents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been expecting that question. Do you
press it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if it embarrasses you to answer. But how
shall I know them when they are given up to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very confidential,&#8221; he said, his face
wrinkling in perplexed thought. He paused, and
then with a sigh added, very slowly, the words seeming
to be wrung from him almost: &#8220;I suppose there
is no other way. They affect Germany and Austria.
They include a secret treaty with Austria and a number
of plans of fortresses, and the army mobilization
schemes, etc., of our neighbours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand your anxiety, Prince,&#8221; I said
drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;They <i>must</i> be recovered, M. Denver, at any cost
or sacrifice,&#8221; he answered with intense earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do my best,&#8221; I replied, and then we turned
to discuss the details of the project. He told me his
arrangements, the chief of which was his scheme to
secure my safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take exactly the same precautions as if
you were His Majesty himself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The carriage
in which you travel will be followed; its description
will be telephoned everywhere, so that it may
be instantly recognized by our agents who to-morrow
night will be stationed at the corner of every street
of the capital. Within a minute of your entering the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
house, wherever it is, a large force will commence to
converge upon it; and if there is any delay or
treachery the place will be carried by force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a breach of faith with Boreski?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I gave him an official pledge the carriage
should not be followed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Official? Rather a nice distinction, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;One has to do these things officially.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you have to give a pledge and&mdash;break
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;We are dealing with
a scoundrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that justify unclean methods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unclean?&#8221; He caught at the word angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said unclean. Please understand me. I am
neither a courtier nor a diplomat, but just a plain
American citizen; and when we Americans pledge
our word we keep it, whether it be given to an honest
man or a rogue. This pledge of yours must be kept,
Prince Kalkov.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grew excited for the first time, and gesticulated
vehemently as he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible, impossible!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You
cannot appreciate the importance of those papers, M.
Denver. Hitherto we have been unable to learn their
whereabouts, but we know that to-morrow night they
will be in the house to which Boreski will drive you;
that is why this appointment is to be kept. And
when we once know where they are, not this Boreski
nor ten thousand Boreskis shall prevent my recovering
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>This cast a somewhat fresh light on the thing, and
annoyed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must get some one else to keep the
appointment, Prince Kalkov,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your promise,&#8221; he cried, angry and embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My promise was to play the part of the Emperor
in the matter, and I&#8217;ll either be obeyed as Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
or we&#8217;ll call it off, and I&#8217;ll remain plain Harper C.
Denver. You can choose, right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat gnawing his moustache in perplexity, and
wanted to expostulate and argue the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no buts in this. You can call it off or
on&mdash;but on my terms. You can choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was just what he did not wish to do, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own safety&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can leave that to me,&#8221; I cut in. &#8220;Is it to
be on or off?&#8221; And I looked him fair and square
in the eyes.</p>

<p>He gave a deep-drawn sigh, twisted his moustache
ends, made as if to expostulate, but stopped on meeting
my looks, and then with a shrug of the shoulders
gave way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an enormous responsibility, but if you insist
I must yield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; then we&#8217;ll be off to bed and leave the
rest until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and gave me his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, M. Denver. You are a strong man,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Prince. We&#8217;ll talk about strength
when the job&#8217;s finished. I&#8217;ll do my best, as I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused by the door and turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all the whole thing is only tricking Boreski.
I wish you&#8217;d let me do it my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a trick, of course; but the cards are on
the table so far as the personation is concerned. I
can&#8217;t give in to the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As your Majesty pleases,&#8221; he returned with a
slow smile as he left the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
<span class="smcap">Chapter III</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE EMPEROR STARTS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; DID not leave my rooms on the following day,
and passed the chief part of it preparing for
the part I was to play in the evening, and discussing
the details.</p>

<p>The Prince and I had several interviews, and his
confidential attendant, a Frenchman named Pierre,
waited on me. From him I had a number of hints
as to little characteristics of the Emperor, gestures,
movements, habits and so on, calculated to help out
my rendering of the part.</p>

<p>We arranged that I should go in ordinary morning
dress, and over this I was to wear a semi-military
cloak borrowed from the Imperial wardrobe.</p>

<p>The papers I required were all prepared with scrupulous
care. These were a patent of nobility making
Boreski a Count&mdash;and I was instructed how to perform
the little ceremony of investing him with it;
a written consent to his marriage with the Duchess
Stephanie; and a draft upon the Imperial Treasury
for the sum of a million roubles.</p>

<p>&#8220;The draft is post dated, as you see,&#8221; said the
Prince, &#8220;as the money is intended for the Duchess&#8217;s
dowry, and is not payable until the marriage. You
can explain this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll probably look for the money down,&#8221; I objected
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dealing with an Emperor who would not
break faith with him,&#8221; returned the Prince with a
grim smile reminiscent of our previous night&#8217;s discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;If these papers are so valuable, why not give the
money at once and let me take it in bank notes?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>&#8220;When we have the papers we can deal with him
for a tenth part of the sum. A million, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your economic instincts lead to trouble, don&#8217;t
blame me,&#8221; I returned a little sharply. &#8220;I repeat
I think you should send notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty can promise him anything. If he
raises any difficulty he can come to me,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing else I have to take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing except this ring of the Emperor&#8217;s. You
had better wear it, as it is well known; and perhaps
had better take a revolver, although I don&#8217;t think you
will have any trouble calling for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One never knows,&#8221; said I, and decided to take his
advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, of course, be cautious not to attempt a
word of Russian. Your accent would betray you in
a moment. You can use French with absolute safety,
as His Majesty&#8217;s unfortunate preference for that language
is well known. That is most important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likely to forget. I can understand everything
in Russian, but I know my limitations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will go and get ready to accompany you
on the first part of the journey to the rendezvous at
the Square of St. Peter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that the time was so close I was a good deal
excited and impatient for the curtain to go up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have His Majesty&#8217;s figure and walk remarkably,
m&#8217;sieur,&#8221; said the Prince&#8217;s man watching me
closely. &#8220;From behind I myself should be deceived
even at so short a distance and in so good a light as
this. It is wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I can&#8217;t keep my back turned to
people all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true, m&#8217;sieur; but then it is always safer
to turn the face to&mdash;dangers, is it not?&#8221; He put
so much emphasis on the word that I turned and looked
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think a good deal of the dangers, then,
Pierre?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>&#8220;There is always danger in this Russia;&#8221; and he
grimaced to show his French dislike of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only a valet, m&#8217;sieur, they pass over my
head. But I have been fifteen years in the country
and have seen many strange things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Emperor were really going on this business,
you think he would run big risks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be different with you, m&#8217;sieur; you may
be discovered in time. But if it were the Emperor,
I should rub my hands with pleasure to see him return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take a cheerful view of things, Pierre. I
expect you have a liver that troubles you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw up his hands and shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans and English are the same and like
mad risks. But I would not do this&mdash;no, not for the
crown of Russia. I know what I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do it for the love of the thing, and I suppose
that&#8217;s about the difference between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur is monsieur,&#8221; he replied with a comical,
lachrymose air. &#8220;But you will need to be very cautious.
You have friends in Petersburg, probably?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. No one knows of my presence here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is strange&mdash;but perhaps&mdash;convenient.
You would not be missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not by a soul except here in the Palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are discovered, m&#8217;sieur, I should not let
that fact be known. I should speak of many. A
friendless man may be a helpless one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a pleasant imagination, Pierre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia is not France, m&#8217;sieur, nor America,&#8221; he
replied, cryptically, with so lugubrious an air that I
smiled.</p>

<p>It was not a cheerful send-off, and in the carriage
I told old Kalkov what his man had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierre is a good valet but a fool,&#8221; he answered
with a grunt. &#8220;He had his nerves twisted once in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
a Nihilist row, and ever since has seen a Nihilist conspiracy
in every trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t take these conspiracies seriously?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule, no; occasionally they are dangerous
of course; but generally little more than froth and
wind&mdash;mere political dyspepsia from the soured
stomach of sectional discontent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Boreski a Nihilist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly. It is always possible. But I think not.
We shall know much more when you return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do return, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally;&#8221; and he smiled, not pleasantly.</p>

<p>I began to think how the cat must have felt when
she had burnt her foot in drawing the chestnuts out
of the fire and saw the monkey enjoying them. But
it was too late to retreat now, even if I had been so
minded. The Prince felt something of this, I fancy,
for he gave me the opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have any fear, M. Denver, and wish to
draw back, we can return to the Palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on any account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to feel, whatever happens, that you
have gone into the thing quite voluntarily. I wish
to feel that too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see it through, Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like an American,&#8221; he replied promptly,
and a minute afterwards the carriage stopped. &#8220;We
have arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>We got out on the north side of a large square
and looked about for the other carriage. None was
in sight, but a hooded automobile stood in the shadow
on the opposite side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can that be it?&#8221; I asked the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be very easily traced,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But not so easily followed. There is no other
and we are already a few minutes behind time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can cross and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face was full of doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better go alone,&#8221; I replied, detaining him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8220;As you will. God send you may be successful
for the sake of Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was intensely earnest, and with the words
ringing in my ears I swung off into the road in the
direction of the autocar, and when I turned once
I saw him watching me intently and eagerly.</p>

<p>Now that the moment for action had really come,
I was as cool as I could have wished. I took a mental
note of everything and I was careful to assume so
far as possible the swinging stride of the man I was
personating.</p>

<p>As I neared the car a man stepped from inside it
and touched his cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is your master?&#8221; I asked, putting all the
authority I could into my manner, and staring hard
at the man. He was dressed like a chauffeur, and
save for his black beard and moustache his face was
almost hidden by the peak of his cap and a pair of
hideous driving goggles.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski, m&#8217;sieur.&#8221; His French was that of
an educated man, I thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your instructions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are waiting for some one from the Palace,
m&#8217;sieur.&#8221; The &#8220;we&#8221; struck me as peculiar. I stopped
by the car and looked harder at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak French with a good accent, my man,&#8221;
I said, with some suspicion in my tone, and then the
unexpected happened.</p>

<p>A girl, closely veiled, put her head out from the
hood which covered the back seat, and with a dash
of contempt said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The American will scarcely be afraid to trust himself
with a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave a start of genuine pleasure. It was the girl
who had spoken to me on the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;With you, mademoiselle, I would trust myself
anywhere;&#8221; and without hesitation I took the seat
by her side.</p>

<p>The chauffeur got into his place and we were off at
a smart pace into the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>I looked back at old Kalkov and waved my hand
to him, and as we whirled round the corner out of the
square he drew himself up and gave me a military
salute.</p>

<p>If I had any doubts before, they vanished the
moment I was by the side of the girl. The adventure
had taken just the turn I could have wished; and
come what might, I was resolved to have a good
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Prince Kalkov, your Majesty?&#8221; she
asked, speaking in Russian. I answered in French.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my very faithful old friend and counsellor
to whose planning I owe this&mdash;this excursion, shall
we call it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, please. This is a very unusual matter. I
make one condition at the outset. My incognito must
be strictly maintained by every one&mdash;by every one,
if you please. I am not the Emperor, but as I told
you yesterday, an American. My name is Harper C.
Denver. I do not even speak the Russian language,
although I can understand it, and I am travelling in
Russia for pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was undeniably as smart as she was pretty.
She listened to me intently, and she asked in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak and understand English then perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a pretty trap, but I was not to be drawn, so
I replied in French&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American must necessarily speak his own
language, mademoiselle;&#8221; and at that she laughed
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doubtless staying at the Hotel Imperial,
the favourite hotel with Americans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am staying at the Palace with my friend
the Emperor;&#8221; a truth which sounded so ridiculous
that she laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be careful that a friend of our Emperor
has his wishes regarded so far as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>We rode some distance after that without speaking
until I broke the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>&#8220;There are three questions I should like to ask,
mademoiselle. Have I your permission?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot pledge myself to answer them, m&#8217;sieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will depend upon whether you have kept
faith with M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we being followed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave express orders to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American citizen can give orders to the police
in Russia then, m&#8217;sieur,&#8221; she put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under certain circumstances an American citizen
can be master of the situation,&#8221; I replied equivocally
and with more truth than she could have any idea
of. &#8220;Will you answer my question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten miles, if all goes well&mdash;if your orders
have been obeyed, that is. We shall soon know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have any proof I can give you of my
good faith in this respect. How shall we know?&#8221;</p>

<p>She appeared to think for a few moments, then
turned and looked at me through her veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean that, there will be no difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word of honour. Let me put
my second question. Do you pledge yourself, you
mademoiselle, personally, for my safety?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unconditionally, and so will M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about him. It is to you I trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt her start and her voice was unsteady as she
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour, your Majesty shall not regret
that confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will do anything and everything you ask.
I put myself absolutely in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose then and spoke to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski says your spies are dogging us and
that the streets are alive with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is M. Boreski?&#8221; I asked indicating the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is M. Boreski. We anticipated there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
would be treachery of the kind.&#8221; There was again
a spice of contempt in her tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I am concerned your suspicions are
unwarranted, mademoiselle. I have been badly served,
and some one shall suffer for it. But what do you
propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you change from this carriage into another
with me, leaving this to be followed by your police?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the same touch of scorn in her manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I will not if you continue to doubt my
personal good faith. I will return to the Palace and
leave the thing to be arranged in some other way.
Otherwise, I am, as I said, absolutely in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced and ashamed of my doubts.
Please forgive me.&#8221; She spoke quickly and eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us make the change as soon as you
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke again to Boreski, and the machine gave
a spurt forward as he increased the speed until we
were flying along at a rate that made conversation
almost impossible.</p>

<p>After some time we swung round a corner and
stopped with a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; cried Boreski eagerly, and in a moment
we two were on the ground and he had started again,
while the girl drew me inside the gates of a house.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see now how you have been obeyed,&#8221; she
said, and the words were scarcely out of her lips
before a vehicle, driven at full gallop with a couple
of mounted men close behind it, went dashing and
clattering past us on the track of the automobile.
&#8220;They are your police, monsieur, and have now a
long ride before them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She referred to them with a shrug of utter contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a short distance to go in the opposite
direction, and shall then find a carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her coolness was admirable, and when we started
to walk she could not have been more unconcerned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
if I had been merely seeing her home from a pink
tea in New York.</p>

<p>We passed through two or three streets, meeting
only a few loungers, and as we crossed a more important
thoroughfare at the corner of which a man
and a woman stood talking, my companion stopped
and asked the woman where we could get a drosky.
She spoke in broken Russian and added&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are Americans and have lost our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find none about here,&#8221; the man answered,
and spoke in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in a fix, it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is the way to St. Mark&#8217;s Square?&#8221; I
asked. &#8220;I know my way from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave us minute directions and we walked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are police spies,&#8221; said my companion
quietly, &#8220;and if we had not spoken to them, they
would probably have followed us. But no one
suspects Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How well you speak English,&#8221; I said, off my
guard for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No better than you, monsieur,&#8221; she replied simply.
&#8220;Your question in English was a great stroke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, two or three times. I was educated there
and in France. What a country of freedom is England.
We shall get our carriage here,&#8221; she said a
little later, and presently it came rumbling along
slowly and stopped at a signal from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not be more than a few minutes now,&#8221;
she said as we got in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not told me your name, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Helga; and take the same surname as
my cousin, M. Boreski&mdash;until my mission is accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mission? What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you some day&mdash;if you will grant me
a hearing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may always depend on that, mademoiselle,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
I answered as earnestly as I felt, so earnestly indeed
that she turned and looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God your Majesty means that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I was still pondering her reply when the carriage
stopped and she told me we had reached our
destination.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">WHEN I WAS CZAR</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS I sat in the sumptuously furnished drawing-room,
waiting for Helga Boreski to join me,
I felt both embarrassed and puzzled.</p>

<p>Who was she? What was the mysterious mission
of which she had spoken? What was her connexion
with this Boreski affair? What part was she playing
in the serio-comic drama in which I had thus suddenly
been involved?</p>

<p>I could see no answer to the questions. I had
made as keen an observation of the house as a few
rapid glances in the darkness would permit; but
could see little more than that it was a large rambling
building standing well secluded in extensive
grounds. Inside, the place contained all the evidences
of considerable wealth, and it was clear somebody
connected with it must have money.</p>

<p>Boreski had been described to me, however, as an
adventurer, who was angling for his duchess in order
to secure her private fortune. He was also unquestionably
blackmailing the Government in the matter
of the million roubles.</p>

<p>Yet the room I was in might have been the parlour
of an American millionaire, so costly and precious
were many of the pictures and ornaments.</p>

<p>Coffee was served to me by footmen who might
have stepped straight from an English peer&#8217;s household;
and altogether, as I say, I was completely
mystified.</p>

<p>My embarrassment came from a quite different
cause. It was one thing to meet an adventurer like
this Boreski with his own weapons and fool him into
an appreciation of his own short-sightedness; but it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
was something very different to treat Helga in the
same way. Rightly or wrongly I had come to the
fixed conviction that, although I had met her in this
very questionable association with Boreski&#8217;s sordid
scheme, she herself was as good as she was beautiful.
And the idea of cheating her, of palming myself off
for the Emperor, was more repugnant than I can say.</p>

<p>I was brooding over the problem with my coffee
untasted when she came in, looking positively radiant.
Her eyes were shining with excitement, her face was
coloured with the glow of the ride; and she had
gowned herself simply, but with exquisite taste, in
subdued tones that set off her magnificent beauty of
face and form to perfection.</p>

<p>Every action and gesture were full of grace, and
as she moved across the room I followed her with
a glance that she must have felt expressed my intense
admiration. I was hopelessly bewitched by her ravishing
beauty; and that is the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you still the American&mdash;as to ceremonial?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please;&#8221; and I motioned to a lounge, feeling
abominably mean. She sank into it with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fresh coffee for&mdash;M. Denver,&#8221; she said to the
servant, pausing on the threshold of the name, and
glancing at me she pointed to my untouched cup.
&#8220;And cigarettes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lighted a cigarette and I did the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wished it all to be informal,&#8221; she said when
the servant had left the room. &#8220;It is also very
extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And very delightful,&#8221; I could not help saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no longer any hesitation as to your own
safety?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have trusted you and am content.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God it may always be so,&#8221; she said earnestly
under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should never doubt <i>you</i>,&#8221; I returned with an
emphasis. &#8220;But frankly I am completely mystified.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>She laughed, and it was like the sound of sweet
sleigh bells.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my house; I live here with an old relative,
Madame Korvata. She is what the Spaniards would
call my duenna, and the English, Mrs. Grundy. But
I am like the Americans&mdash;you Americans,&#8221; she repeated
with a glance; &#8220;in my love of personal freedom.
I do as I like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can believe. And M. Boreski?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is M. Boreski&mdash;that is all to me. He is my
cousin, very distantly my cousin, and he has his plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>She managed to suggest that these schemes were
indifferent to her, and after a short pause added
meaningly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all have plans, haven&#8217;t we? Little moves
of the pawns on the chess board, leading to some
great combination&mdash;perhaps, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski is coming here?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are already impatient to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The retort came quickly with just an accent of
reproach and disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary I am more than content to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me a sharp half-quizzical glance, with a
smile in it, quickly suppressed save in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder can that be true? What kind of test
it would stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any test <i>you</i> could choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see. I may remind you of that;&#8221; half
challenge half banter this was. &#8220;But my concerns
are nothing to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us make them something.&#8221; Our eyes
met as I said this with an earnestness that was personal
if not Imperial, and she met my gaze openly and
steadily. Hers were dangerous eyes for any man to
look into, and especially for one who thought of her
as I did.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what you mean by that? What I ought
to read behind your look and eager offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but goodwill to you. Believe that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>&#8220;You tempt me, monsieur&mdash;American,&#8221; and she
fell back in her chair with a half sigh and sat thinking
intently. Presently she shook her head. &#8220;No, not
yet, not yet. You know nothing of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An ignorance you can easily correct. But no,
you are right, it must not be yet,&#8221; I exclaimed hastily.</p>

<p>I had no right to invite confidence from her until
she knew who I really was. But my exclamation
surprised her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not yet&mdash;from your side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you. How long will M. Boreski
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>She wrinkled her brow at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you would first know what my connexion
with his scheme is? A somewhat shallow
trust yours, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may seem so, but I did not mean that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what did you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes again sought mine as if to read my
thoughts. I threw up a blockading smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will he be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You play with me,&#8221; she exclaimed petulantly.
&#8220;I do not make a pleasant plaything. M. Boreski
will be here soon now. He will find some one to
take his place and play hare to your police dogs&mdash;the
dogs that were not to have been set upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Us&#8217;?&#8221; I repeated with a lift of the eyebrows.
&#8220;You <i>do</i> identify yourself with him then?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a man&#8217;s retort. Suspicion for suspicion;
and it serves me right. Now that the time has come,
I am not myself. I am too anxious. I do not understand&mdash;Americans.
You make me feel as no other
man as ever yet made me feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was this for the Emperor or for myself? I did
not relish the problem and made no reply.</p>

<p>She sighed, and rising touched the bell, and remained
standing while the servants came and removed
the coffee-cups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>I was glad of the interval. It gave me time to
remember my part and remember, too, how unstable
was the ground I stood on.</p>

<p>When the servants had gone again she remained
standing with one elbow resting upon an ebony column
under a branch of electric lights, the soft shaded
colours from which fell upon her, enhancing her
beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the train yesterday you said you wished to
see me again,&#8221; she said slowly in a low seductive
voice. &#8220;You have had your wish, you see. It is
good to be&mdash;an American. Will you have the same
wish after to-night, I wonder. I wonder,&#8221; she added
musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a graver question whether you would grant
the wish if I expressed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you doubt it? You need not.&#8221; And then
quickly as if to get on to safer ground, &#8220;The wishes
of such an American must be commands to&mdash;to
Russian subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>I winced and my face clouded, and I wished my
Imperial character at the bottom of the Black Sea.
She was quick to notice the change.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have offended you. How?&#8221; There was eagerness
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I have offended myself, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; I returned
with a little sigh of vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hard to understand,&#8221; she murmured
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without the key to the riddle, yes;&#8221; and once
more we lapsed into silence. During the pause she
resumed her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski should be here now, monsieur,&#8221; she
said at length, a notable difference in her tone. &#8220;You
are going to grant his request?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to obtain the papers he holds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you will find him difficult to deal with
after the police incident to-night. Police spies are
to him an abomination. You had none yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Why do you run such risks as to travel quite unattended?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran no risk. No one knew me,&#8221; I answered,
rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against what were you warning me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She read suspicion in the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a Nihilist; but Russia is Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know something of these Nihilists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know many of them to be reckless desperate
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One has to take chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think this what you term a chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid. But I am glad of your repudiation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you need it?&#8221; she asked, her eyes on mine
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you I trust you, and I think have
shown it. But you are an enigma.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled and leaned forward until her face was
near to mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think me worth the trouble of solving?&#8221;
and she was still waiting for my answer and gazing
at me when, to my chagrin, the door opened and
Boreski entered.</p>

<p>I recognized him instantly from his photograph;
an aristocrat to his finger-tips he appeared to me,
with a perfect manner; as striking a personality in
his way as Helga herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski,&#8221; said Helga, rising, and he made a
courtier-like bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am more honoured than I can say by the condescension
of this interview, your Majesty,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Pray pardon my lateness, but it is due to circumstances
beyond my control.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I knew he had been leading the police on a wild
goose chase I had to restrain an inclination to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle here has already anticipated your
explanation, monsieur,&#8221; I said; and the two exchanged
quick glances. &#8220;It was contrary to my express orders
that you were followed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>&#8220;A very direct and precise pledge was given me,
your Majesty, by His Highness Prince Kalkov.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner more than his words made me understand
that he held he had been badly treated and
resented strongly the breach of faith. This was the
crossing of the weapons in the game of fence between
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not customary for me to explain my position
twice, M. Boreski,&#8221; I said with a lofty air. &#8220;Let
us get to the business of the interview if you please.
You will be seated,&#8221; and I waved my hand to a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank your Majesty,&#8221; he replied with a deferential
bow as he sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;We understand, of course, the peculiar nature of
circumstances leading to the interview and the importance
attached to the papers which you have.
Where are they, if you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready to be produced the moment your Majesty
has settled the preliminaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have named very high terms, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness, in your Majesty&#8217;s name, has already
agreed to them,&#8221; he returned quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are now face to face, monsieur, and we
can re-open the whole matter. I propose to do that,
and I invite you to tell me now precisely your ultimate
object and your inner motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The question surprised him, and he pursed his lips
and frowned in thought and looked across at Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand your Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, monsieur, you must do that. You
are young, you have a great career before you as a
maestro, they tell me, a career which means ample
rewards in money in these days&mdash;so that you cannot
be seeking money only. What, then, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty is good enough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay,&#8221; I put in then. &#8220;I have explained to
Mademoiselle Helga that I am strictly incognito. Regard
me as no other than the American, Mr. Denver,
and let us talk this out as man to man. Forget that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
there is any one present but a private individual who
has influence with an absent Emperor. Now tell me
frankly what is the real object you are seeking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very gracious, but my object has already
been explained&mdash;I desire to marry the Duchess
Stephanie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a means to what end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage is an end in itself,&#8221; said Helga, speaking
for the first time, and coming to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would make M. Boreski a mere fortune-hunter,
mademoiselle, an extremely distasteful and
invidious part to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were both surprised at the turn of things
and were silent for some moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought this part of the matter had been definitely
settled,&#8221; said Helga; and then for the first time
a suspicion crossed my mind that the man was taking
his cue from her.</p>

<p>He said quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it has been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you tired of your art, monsieur? If you
were to marry the Duchess Stephanie your career
must of course end. What, then, do you expect to
gain in its place? Money? What is a million roubles&#8221;&mdash;I
only just avoided saying a hundred thousand dollars&mdash;&#8220;to
a man with your gifts? Do you seek place,
power, influence? Let me remind you, you are forcing
your way into a circle which will never receive you
as an equal. Political influence will be impossible for
you&mdash;the Emperor himself would be inflexible on
that point. If I read you aright, you are a man with
ambition and individuality; and neither ambition nor
individuality is content to be a mere adjunct to a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In America is not affection regarded as a possible
basis of marriage, M. Denver?&#8221; asked Helga; and I
turned with a smile to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My kinswoman&#8221;&mdash;I made the slip intentionally
and then corrected it&mdash;&#8220;the Duchess Stephanie is
no longer so fascinating as in her youth, mademoiselle.
I am only dealing with facts.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>&#8220;M. Denver has no wish to insult me or the Duchess,
I am sure,&#8221; said Boreski, a suggestion of anger in
his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand then that you are in love with
the Duchess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a point which, with all deference, I will
not discuss,&#8221; he returned firmly; but despite his firm
tone I thought I could discern evidence that I had
struck home.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski is irrevocably pledged to the Duchess,&#8221;
said Helga, &#8220;and in honour he could not draw back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Emperor would find means to meet that difficulty,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;But be it so. I have come with the
written consent to the marriage;&#8221; and I took out the
papers which Prince Kalkov had given me, glanced
at them and laid them on the table.</p>

<p>Boreski&#8217;s face brightened. Then I added casually&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought, indeed, that we might
have torn up the consent to the marriage and made
the draft here for two millions instead of one. A
fortune and individual freedom would have seemed
to me preferable&mdash;especially if coupled with it was
a complete condonation of all other matters and&mdash;intrigues.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused before the word and watched him. The
mention of the higher sum had brought a light of
avarice into his eyes, which gave way abruptly to
surprise and suspicion as I finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intrigues?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Helga who put the question, and Boreski
looked across at her so doubtfully as to suggest fear.
Then he took out his handkerchief and wiped his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intrigues, mademoiselle,&#8221; I replied quietly. &#8220;M.
Boreski knows my meaning.&#8221; This forced him to
speak, and his voice was nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at a loss to understand you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused and looked at him steadily until his eyes
fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sources of secret information are so many,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
monsieur, that I am sure you can ascertain that.
Shall we say twice the amount and tear up this
consent?&#8221;</p>

<p>He fidgetted with his handkerchief, and then making
a great effort for self-possession he put it away and
answered, with a spice of doggedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have named my terms and they have been agreed
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will. But of course you understand that
without that condonation&mdash;or pardon&mdash;even one so
highly placed as the husband of the Duchess Stephanie
may be called upon to answer for his acts.&#8221;</p>

<p>I waited to give him a last chance, and during the
silence he was obviously embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make grave accusations very lightly, M.
Denver,&#8221; said Helga, coming to the rescue again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we cannot prove them, mademoiselle?&#8221;
I asked looking her straight in the face. The
man&#8217;s manner made me very sure. But she could act
much better than he: women can as a rule. Her
steady look changed to a winning smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do men do in America, monsieur, when
they are so fortunate as to discover a mare&#8217;s nest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They console themselves if they find in it a woman&#8217;s
smile, mademoiselle,&#8221; I replied lightly, &#8220;or take her
assurance that it is nothing more serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can be more serious than a woman&#8217;s smile,
M. American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s nihilism, mademoiselle, for one thing.
But come, here are the papers, M. Boreski. I shall
have the pleasure of addressing you as Count, I shall
hand to you the consent to your unmercenary marriage,
and shall give you the draft for a million roubles as
the dowry conferred by a grateful Emperor. Where
are the papers for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand to his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused suddenly and then said hesitatingly,
&#8220;I&mdash;I will get them. I have your permission
to withdraw?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>He had himself in hand again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to return&mdash;with the papers. Will you also
see that a carriage is ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he rose I intercepted a very meaning glance
between the two, and then once more Helga and I
were alone.</p>

<p>All had gone smoothly so far; but there was clearly
much that I did not yet understand, and I turned to
Helga to question her.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">A CZAR DEFIED</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HELGA met my eyes readily with something like
a challenge in her own, and as the first question
was on my lips, a thought struck me. It was odd that
coming to such an interview he had not brought the
papers with him. I said so to her.</p>

<p>For answer she just looked at me and smiled. If
she did not know the disarming power of her smile
I felt it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You like to mystify me,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you so hard on poor M. Boreski, and
why&#8221;&mdash;she paused as if to calculate the effect
of her words&mdash;&#8220;why do you suspect us of being
Nihilists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? I did not say anything about you. It was
M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that quite candid, M. American?&#8221; It was
an audacious stroke, considering whom she believed
me to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your assurance would suffice to convince me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You put your sharp questions in flattering covers,
monsieur. But your compliments have barbed points.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a barbed point that I would trust your word
implicitly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought that, oh, if I <i>could</i> think it,&#8221; she
exclaimed with great earnestness, clasping her hands
strenuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you doubt it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned full upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you do not know me; because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she
broke off and then said steadily, almost defiantly:
&#8220;I am no Nihilist, nor is M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>&#8220;And he has had no dealings with them?&#8221; I felt
convinced that he had. &#8220;I mean to your knowledge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cross-examine like a lawyer.&#8221; A flash of
scorn was in her eyes as she looked at me angrily.
&#8220;If we have had what you term dealings with them,
it was because it was necessary, and no other way
was left to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not afraid to handle edged tools, and
I am sorry to hear what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of anything that can help my
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of Nihilism helping anything or
anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I choose my own means, and go my own way,&#8221;
she said defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can believe that; but I am not accusing you,
nor need you defend yourself&mdash;to me. I believe that
whatever you have done, you have been driven to
do, and have believed yourself justified in doing&mdash;for
this great purpose you speak of. But others may
think very differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not ask what it is. You do not care, I
suppose. Yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; There was pain now in her
voice, and a sigh finished the broken sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is better that I should not ask,&#8221; I said after
a pause. She had made me forget for the moment,
in my solicitude for her, that I must not have her
confidence. &#8220;When will M. Boreski return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My purpose is revenge,&#8221; she cried with sudden
vehemence, her face suddenly set and stern and her
eyes bright. &#8220;Revenge for a cruel, cowardly crime,
and wrongs as deep and bitter as ever weighed a
woman to the earth and filled her heart with burning
rage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you, mademoiselle, to say no more,&#8221; I
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wish to tell you. I must, I must. It concerns
the pampered villain who holds your confidence,
Prince Kalkov, and&#8221;&mdash;she paused and looked at me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
her face fevered with excitement and her eyes full of
dread doubt, and then added in a low strenuous tone&mdash;&#8220;Prince
Boris Lavalski.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had never heard the name, of course, and could
not understand her intense agitation. She searched
my face as if hungry for some sign of recognition,
and seeing none, her own clouded and then paled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Boris Lavalski,&#8221; I echoed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my God, my God, that it has come to this!&#8221;
she cried in a passion of despair; and she hid her face
in her hands, giving way to such uncontrollable emotion
that my heart was wrung for her.</p>

<p>She remained some minutes in the stress of her
whirlwind grief; most embarrassing minutes to me,
for I knew not what to do or say, gladly as I would
have said or done anything to soften her distress.</p>

<p>Suddenly she mastered her emotion, rose and faced
me, her face worn, strained, and white to the very
lips, which quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;So be it, monsieur. You are still his enemy&mdash;and
mine,&#8221; she said in low measured tones. &#8220;Still the
defender of that cruel monstrous infamy. We are
then to fight on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am utterly at a loss to understand you, mademoiselle.
God knows I am no enemy of yours, and
would only too gladly be your friend if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is impossible, monsieur,&#8221; she interposed
angrily, with the air of an empress. &#8220;Shall M.
Boreski return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been waiting for him,&#8221; said I, still mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent him away that I might speak to you of
this.&#8221; She touched the bell as she spoke, and I
noticed that she pushed it twice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know that you were his principal,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many things you do not know yet:
as many indeed as you seem quite unwilling to remember,
or anxious to forget.&#8221; She was very bitter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>&#8220;Is it necessary, monsieur?&#8221; she asked contemptuously,
making one feel about as mean as a man
could feel.</p>

<p>Until M. Boreski came in we said no more, and
as he entered he shot a swift questioning glance at
Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty is anxious to conclude the interview,
M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to take his cue from her words and
hostile manner.</p>

<p>It was clear that a considerable change was at
hand, and I awaited the unfolding of it with interest.</p>

<p>Boreski treated me with the same deference as before,
and having asked my permission, resumed his
seat and produced the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers for the Emperor are here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give them me;&#8221; and I held out my hand for them.</p>

<p>But this he would not.</p>

<p>&#8220;With extreme deference I submit that I be allowed
first to examine those which you bring, monsieur. If
the request should appear strange, I beg you to remember
that Prince Kalkov has already once broken
faith with me this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are cautious, Count Boreski.&#8221; He started and
flushed with pleasure as I thus addressed him by his
new title. &#8220;But why should I trust them to you?
If it comes to faith-breaking, are not those documents
stolen? Surely there is a breach of more than faith
behind your possession of them. Why then should
I trust you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear then we have reached an <i>impasse</i>,&#8221; he
said, with a courteous bow as he spread out his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. Hand yours to Mademoiselle
Helga.&#8221; I turned to her. &#8220;You will hold them,
mademoiselle, and give them to me when this cautious
gentleman has satisfied himself that these are in
order?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your permission, the matter is no concern
of mine,&#8221; she replied coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>&#8220;It seems to me that you are both anxious to raise
difficulties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga shrugged her shoulders, and Boreski spread
out his hands deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all deference, I submit I am not asking too
much to be allowed to examine documents of such
vital importance to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought for a moment. If I parted with the
papers and did not get the others in exchange I
should be pretty considerably euchred; but on the
other hand his request was not unreasonable. Then
I saw the way out. I remembered that I was armed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You can see them,&#8221; and I pushed
them across to him, and rising, stood between him
and the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your confidence in our honour is very striking,
monsieur,&#8221; said Helga scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that fair? I offered to trust them to you, and
you replied it was no concern of yours. I am now
dealing with the holder of stolen documents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you judge M. Boreski by the standard of the
persons who surround and advise you continually. No
doubt you are right according to your experience,&#8221;
was her bitterly spoken retort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your anger and injustice are too manifest to need
a further reply from me, mademoiselle,&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>Boreski scrutinized the papers carefully, and presently
I saw him start and lay one aside. I wondered
if he could have discovered any forgery among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one grave point here, and one of less importance,&#8221;
he said at length; and putting the papers
together he handed them back to me, with the draft
for the money on the top. &#8220;This draft is dated three
days hence.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took them and went back to my seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason is obvious. This is in the nature of a
dowry, and as such will be paid on your marriage, and
not before it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all submission, I cannot so regard it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
I cannot accept the draft as complying with the
agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just the hitch I had foreseen and pointed out
to old Kalkov; but how to get over it I did not see.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the point of minor importance; what is
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The consent to the marriage is dated, and if a date
is to remain, it should be that of a week or a month
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the quick question he looked across at Helga,
who shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see why you should not say. It concerns
both the objections and accounts for them,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess Stephanie is already my wife, monsieur,&#8221;
said Boreski.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil she is,&#8221; I exclaimed in genuine astonishment.
&#8220;That puts the whole thing on a totally different
footing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It entails the consent being dated back, and makes
the dowry payable at once, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means also that you have put your head in a
noose, and have forfeited the Duchess&#8217;s fortune, since
her marriage has taken place without my&mdash;without
the Emperor&#8217;s consent;&#8221; and I folded up the papers
and put them back in my pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly produces a quite interesting complication,&#8221;
said Helga, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not affect the gravity of the papers I hold
here,&#8221; and Boreski tapped them slowly with his long
white fingers.</p>

<p>For the life of me I couldn&#8217;t see a way out of the
maze. Had I been really the Emperor, I might have
done it by sending instructions to old Kalkov to pay
the million roubles; then by writing a fresh consent
to the marriage I could have secured the papers, and
so have made an end of the thing.</p>

<p>But I felt that Kalkov would only laugh at such a
request from me, while of course I could not write a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
single word without the discrepancy of the handwriting
being at once apparent.</p>

<p>I was loth to go back and admit my failure; but
this I saw at length was the only resource. Every
moment that I hesitated made the affair worse, so I
put as bold a front on matters as I could and got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;This new admission of yours, M. Boreski,&#8221; I said
with an assumption of dignity, &#8220;is so serious as to
require consideration. Be good enough to have a
carriage brought for me at once. The interview is
at an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had risen with me and stood in indecision, when
Helga interposed and took the lead in her own hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not quite understand the position, I fear,
monsieur,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean I am not free to go&mdash;after your
promise to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, no,&#8221; she cried, with one of her smiles.
&#8220;I myself will order your carriage.&#8221; She rang the
bell, and when the servant came she told him to order
a carriage at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure of you, mademoiselle, and regret my
hasty suspicion. You will pardon it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a natural inference&mdash;for one accustomed
to treachery,&#8221; she replied, with soft sarcasm. &#8220;But
we really are not traitors here. The way is open for
you to leave&mdash;if you dare, monsieur?&#8221; And the
challenge was in eyes, face, voice and manner alike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dare? That is a strong word, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Intentionally strong,&#8221; she retorted, with cutting
deliberation. &#8220;Intentionally strong. I have been patient
under injury, and have endured injustice, hoping,
praying, and waiting for redress; living for the
interview which I have had to-night&mdash;and had in
vain. And now my patience is exhausted, and you
have drained it to the dregs. Had there been a spark
of just feeling left in your heart, a faint wan glimmer
of desire to right the wrong done to mine and to me,
and to wipe out the cruel stain of unmerited infamy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the name I mentioned to you to-night would have
kindled the desire until, fanned by the remembrance
of old and tried and dear friendship, it would have
burned steadily with a bright avenging flame.&#8221; She
spoke without passion in slow level accents.</p>

<p>I had not the faintest suspicion of her meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name was that?&#8221; I asked, having even
forgotten it.</p>

<p>The question drew a smile of contempt from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not insult myself by repeating it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage is at the door, mademoiselle,&#8221; announced
the servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go, monsieur,&#8221; she said, when the man
had left.</p>

<p>But she had startled as well as interested me, and
I hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you should speak more plainly. I am
honest when I say I do not understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreski had now passed out of consideration, and
he stood back watching us two, as if acknowledging
her leadership.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish for plain speaking. You shall have it,
monsieur&mdash;from the enemy you have made to-night.
This is my work,&#8221; she said proudly, pointing to the
papers in Boreski&#8217;s hands. &#8220;My work, only. I
sought at first by all fair means to reach your&mdash;the
Emperor&#8217;s ear, believing, like the fool I was, that he
would do me justice. But his minister was too powerful,
too vigilant, too alarmed to let my complaint reach
his ear. I knew why. God, how well I knew it!
Then, and not until then, when I had failed by open
means, I had recourse to these. I joined hands with
another of Russia&#8217;s victims, M. Boreski here, and
with him, through the Duchess Stephanie, I found
the means I sought. God knows Russian duplicity
gives many chances, and one of them came my way,
putting me in a position to gain by force the justice
which was denied to mere pleading.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused again, but I did not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>&#8220;Those papers&mdash;but you know their purport well
enough&mdash;mean the exposure of Russian craft in every
Court in Europe, with probably a war with the Powers
that have been tricked and fooled. They know already
that we have secret information, and we have been in
negotiation with them. But I am a Russian, too, and
planned this interview, hoping that when face to face
with you I could touch the heart so long dead to the
cries of friendship. I have failed; I see that. You
will not remember; you cannot forget; even for you
that would be impossible. You have denied me justice,
but I thank my God you cannot take from me all
my revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her passion was rising fast now under the stimulus
of her remembered wrongs, and she went to the door
and threw it open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, monsieur, go,&#8221; she cried, with a magnificent
gesture of defiance. &#8220;Cross the threshold in the mood
you are, and as I live, those papers, proofs as they are
of your ministers&#8217; infamous treachery, shall be in the
hands already stretched out eagerly to receive them&mdash;the
hands of Russia&#8217;s enemies. That is what I
mean. Go, monsieur, go&mdash;if you dare.&#8221; She held
the door open and stared at me in indignant defiance
and challenge.</p>

<p>Was ever a man caught in a closer meshed net than
that which held me at that moment?</p>

<p>I stood fumbling with the situation in sheer and
desperate perplexity. I remembered old Kalkov&#8217;s
words that the papers might plunge the country into
war, and that at any cost they must not be allowed
to get into the hands of the Powers concerned. Yet
if I left the house it was straight to those Powers
they would go.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, I remained, what could I do?</p>

<p>If I admitted to Helga that I was no Emperor, but
a fraud, her anger would probably be increased, and
she would carry out her purpose just the same. While
if I went on playing at being Emperor, and listened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
to her story, I could do no good. It was out of my
power to grant her the justice which she deemed
had been denied. I should only be cheating her and
emphasizing the lie which my presence as Emperor
constituted.</p>

<p>To fall back on old Kalkov and curse him for having
got me into the mess was comforting but unpractical;
and I stood like a fool, probably looking the
fool I felt, as I gnawed my moustache and twisted my
beard in imbecile indecision.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VI</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">HIS MAJESTY A PRISONER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HOW long I stood there, hesitating and embarrassed,
while Helga was holding the door open
for me in that queenly pose of splendid indignation,
I do not know, but realizing at last that I could not
go and leave her to execute her threat, I turned back
rather sheepishly and sat down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have put the thing on such a different and
so unexpected a footing that we had better wait at
least until you are calmer,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>But she was in the mood to push her triumph to
the utmost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never be calm on this subject. It is for
you to say at once, monsieur, whether you decide
to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any such necessity,&#8221; I answered curtly.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe my condition of mind. The
thing was really nothing to me. Whether Russia went
to war with twenty other countries would not have
troubled me. I had no concern whether her diplomatists
had made fools of themselves, and that Helga
should have them by the throat rather pleased than
angered me. And yet I was as irritable as a millionaire
when his digestion goes wrong. I suppose I was
in a temper at having been beaten. No one cares to
look small in the eyes of a woman he admires as I
admired her. And small I certainly felt and must
have looked.</p>

<p>Although I avoided her eyes, she stood holding the
door still open, and looking at me as if to read my
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>&#8220;Are you going, monsieur?&#8221; she asked, after a
long pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not&mdash;yet.&#8221; I spoke bluntly, almost
rudely; and with a shrug and a lift of the eyebrows,
she left the door and crossed the room to her former
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski, will you see that the carriage is sent
back to the stable, and is kept in readiness for M.
Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreski understood her, and going out shut the door
carefully behind him.</p>

<p>I made no attempt to speak, but sat staring moodily
down on the ground and trying to think; and Helga
on her side was resolutely silent. Several minutes
passed in this dead silence until it got on my nerves.
She forced me to break it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it you want?&#8221; I asked, most
ungraciously.</p>

<p>The way she met me was characteristic. She
laughed softly and sweetly, and looked across at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mood has passed, monsieur,&#8221; she said, quoting
my words. &#8220;Shall we wait for yours to pass
also? Permit me?&#8221; and she rose and offered me a
cigarette from a dainty gold case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather smoke something stronger, with
your leave.&#8221; I took out a cigar, and she lighted a
cigarette; and another long silence fell between us.
She broke it this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made me your enemy, and I have beaten
you so far; but you will not find me ungenerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Generous or ungenerous, I don&#8217;t see any way out
of the tangle. I won&#8217;t listen to any more of your
story; and you can&#8217;t use those papers. I don&#8217;t know
what it is you want, and if I did, it would be no
use, for I could not grant it. And there&#8217;s the deadlock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it, after all, necessary that we should be
enemies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently it is. There are certain things which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
I cannot tell you from my side, and certain others I
will not hear from you. It is your own fault.&#8221; This
was very un-Imperial talk, but I was sick of the
whole Emperor business, and still suffering from
mortification.</p>

<p>The change in my manner appeared to strike her,
for she looked at me sharply and replied as if with
surprise&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I ventured to ask you for your confidence
about yourself, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean to imply that you had. There is
one thing,&#8221; I added, as an idea occurred to me. &#8220;Shall
I send for Prince Kalkov?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances shall he cross my door,&#8221;
she answered with prompt and unmistakable resolution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you postpone dealing with those papers then
until I have had an opportunity of consulting him?
That may prove a solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Prince Kalkov too well. Within five
minutes of your leaving my house those papers will
be on their way to the destination I have indicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then in Heaven&#8217;s name what are we to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will listen to my story you will see that
Prince Kalkov is the man I accuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are insuperable reasons why I cannot
and will not listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is for you to find the solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can probably do that if I can communicate with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I order the carriage again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Checkmate again, and I tossed up my hands in
hopeless perplexity.</p>

<p>She was obviously resolved that I should hear all
she had to say, and I was equally determined, knowing
the worse than futility of the thing, not to listen
to her; and there we sat, in a contest of wills and
wits, until the absurd side of the position began to
appeal to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>&#8220;It seems to me you are resolved to make me a
prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, monsieur, the door is open, and
a carriage ready at your instant command. If you
remain, it is by your own desire, and of your own
free will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Free will, when you place an impossible barrier
in the way of my going? So long as I remain here
you will not part with those papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as the hope remains that you will hear
me and do me justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing is so preposterous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The alternative is for you to choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then that I began to contemplate seriously
the course of remaining in the house for the night.
I should at least gain time; and time might bring a
solution.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a dainty prison, but still a prison, although
the bars are invisible, and the gaoler yourself. You
realize the responsibility of what you are doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am prepared to face any responsibility, and you
would be my most honoured guest.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke very seriously, but there was a light in
her eyes that told not only of triumph, but of laughter
scarcely restrained. For all the seriousness behind the
position, she saw the humour of it and enjoyed it.
And so in truth did I; for nothing on earth would
have pleased me better than to be in her company for
any number of days, if I could only have divested
myself of my confounded Imperial character. If she
could have read my thoughts, what would her own
have been!</p>

<p>I had to keep up the farce of assumed disinclination,
however, and was meditating the best line to
take when an interruption came.</p>

<p>The door was opened, and a servant announced&mdash;&#8220;M.
Paul Drexel.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush of extreme annoyance mounted to Helga&#8217;s
face at the entrance of the new-comer, who was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
reverse of a pleasant-looking man. He was about
forty years of age; short, broad-shouldered, inclined
to corpulence, awkward and ungainly in figure. His
features were coarse and Jewish in character; he had
beady, twinkling, stealthy eyes, and his manner suggested
a mixture of truculence and cunning.</p>

<p>Altogether he looked entirely out of place in Helga&#8217;s
drawing-room, and I wondered what on earth could
have brought him there, a wonderment which became
genuine astonishment when he advanced with as much
confidence as if he were the master of the house, and
said in Russian&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Helga. You see I have come after
all. Is this the company you said would engage you?&#8221;
He turned to me with a questioning, half suspicious,
and rather insolent glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had wished you to come I should have asked
you,&#8221; she replied, repressing her ill-humour. &#8220;Your
visit is ill-timed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I watched her very closely and detected something
very much akin to repugnance in her glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly;&#8221; he laughed shortly. &#8220;But as I am
here, introduce me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s indecision before she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman is an American, and does not
speak Russian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;American, is he? Well, I suppose I have a right
to know the friends of my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This time she broke in quickly and interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already told you your visit is unwelcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you,&#8221; he returned so rudely that I could
have kicked him. &#8220;What language does he speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He understands Russian and speaks French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me? I speak French easily
enough;&#8221; the second part of the sentence was in
French. &#8220;Good-evening, monsieur,&#8221; he said to me,
&#8220;I am glad to meet you. Any friends of my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver, this is M. Paul Drexel.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>He started at this second interruption, and looked
at her half angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you wish to say? Why?&#8221; Their eyes
met for a moment, and he seemed to have the best of
it, for Helga added&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am engaged to marry M. Drexel, monsieur.&#8221;
He smiled and rubbed his fat hands over his little
triumph, and was so pleased with himself that my
start of amazement escaped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am of course pleased to know Helga&#8217;s
friends.&#8221; He threw himself into a chair and continued
to rub his podgy hands. If I had thought
him a cad before, he was now positively hateful, and
his vulgar assurance sickened me.</p>

<p>He took out a cigar, and as he turned away to light
it I saw Helga wince, bite her lip, and clench her
hands tightly. I could see that she was suffering;
but this only added to my perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are an American, M. Denver. A fine
country yours; I was never there, but shall go some
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure America will appreciate the honour,&#8221;
I said blandly. It was no concern of mine to conciliate
the little cad; but he only chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, very good. I suppose it did sound as if
I thought I should be honouring the place. But I
am content with Russia;&#8221; and he settled himself in
his luxurious seat as if he were indeed very content.
&#8220;I shall enjoy a talk with you about your American
Government some day, M. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no response to this approach; but it made
no difference to him; no inroad upon the stockade of
his self-complacency. He babbled on with remarks
of the kind, and then let fall a question which seemed
to have something behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have lived much in America?&#8221; and
his beady black eyes shot a swift sly glance at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even Americans are at home sometimes,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good again, good again,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;You are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
great travellers, globe-trotters, eh? And you yourself
speak French so well; quite as well as most Russians
indeed; and you understand Russian too, Helga tells
me. Do many of your countrymen understand Russian?&#8221;
and again the little sharp eyes came at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was in the diplomatic service, M.
Drexel, and as a child I was educated in Russia,
Germany and France, and thus learnt all three
languages.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga gave me a look of thanks which the man
intercepted; and he stared at her, a cunning smile
on his flabby face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a linguist, you see, Helga,&#8221; he said, and
then assuming a casual tone&mdash;&#8220;By the way, the
friend you were expecting did not come after all?&#8221;
The tone did not deceive me. I saw that he knew
who I was supposed to be, and that all this had
merely been intentional monkeying.</p>

<p>Helga saw it as well, and answered calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver is the only friend I was expecting
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why try to fool me? Did you think I
should not recognize&mdash;M. Denver? Haven&#8217;t I a
right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No;&#8221; anger and resolution in the sharp monosyllable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you consider me interested in your plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be glad to finish your cigar with M.
Boreski, M. Drexel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you; I came to see you. I have
nothing to say to Boreski to-night&mdash;unless, of
course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He left the sentence unfinished except
for a look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless what, M. Drexel?&#8221; The anger she had
carefully suppressed until now was getting the upper
hand of her, and he saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless you drive me to it, I mean;&#8221; this doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are at liberty to say what you please to
M. Boreski&mdash;or to any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>&#8220;You are providing me with an excellent opportunity,&#8221;
he retorted, beginning to get angry in his
turn, and glancing at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use it. You may never have a better.&#8221; The
answer was crisp and supercilious&mdash;almost contemptuous.</p>

<p>A quarrel between an engaged couple must always
be embarrassing for a third party, so I cut in&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, mademoiselle, may I withdraw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; she asked, with a bright, quick, challenging
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in your hands,&#8221; I said, smiling back.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have M. Boreski in,&#8221; and she rang the
bell.</p>

<p>The little man fidgetted uncomfortably in his chair
while we waited for the servant and then for Boreski.
When he came Helga murmured an excuse and left
the room.</p>

<p>For an instant the thought that some sinister move
was intended flashed upon my mind, bred, no doubt,
by my distrust of this unctuous little cad; but my
trust in Helga dispelled it. I felt sure of her.</p>

<p>The two men eyed one another a moment, and it
was easy to see that there was little love lost between
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Helga is on stilts again to-night,&#8221;
said Drexel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have come&mdash;unasked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why am I kept out of this?&#8221; The question
asked angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you have no part in it and are not
wanted,&#8221; returned Boreski deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense. I shall do as I like. When you are
tired of me you only have to say so. You know
the alternative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg to tender you an unqualified apology, M.
Denver, for M. Drexel&#8217;s presence,&#8221; said Boreski to
me with his courtier-like air. &#8220;He has forced himself
here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>&#8220;You should have told me then who your mysterious
visitor was, instead of leaving me to fish it
out for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept your apology, M. Boreski,&#8221; I said, in
my grand manner.</p>

<p>The little man flushed angrily and got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of us may live to be sorry for this night&#8217;s
work,&#8221; he said, with an unmistakable threat. It was
clear that he held his position in the house by virtue
of what he could threaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for it already,&#8221; declared Boreski
quietly. He had certainly the knack of putting a
lot of sting into words which in themselves were
innocent enough. &#8220;You should not have come, I
repeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do as I like. I am not to be bullied or
sneered at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will drive me to do one day as <i>I</i> like, M.
Drexel,&#8221; said Boreski in his even suave tone; &#8220;and
make me realize that there are less unpleasant things
than your&mdash;your alternatives. As you ought not to
have come, you had better go.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, to my relief, a servant entered and
said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your apartments are prepared, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men started at this, and both displayed astonishment,
Drexel giving vent to a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid you good-evening, M. Boreski,&#8221; I said; and
then to Drexel: &#8220;Should I meet you or hear of you
again, monsieur, this evening&#8217;s experience will be in
my memory;&#8221; and turning on my heel, I left the
room.</p>

<p>As the door closed I heard Drexel&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God! you play for high stakes, Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga was outside, and also caught the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I hate him!&#8221; she exclaimed vehemently,
her eyes flashing, and her face set and strained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have other enemies&mdash;beside me?&#8221; I
said, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>The hard look passed away as she let her eyes rest
on mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not always be my enemy, I hope, M.
American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could never be anything but your friend&mdash;even
prisoner as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I order your carriage, monsieur?&#8221; with
smiling audacious banter. &#8220;My guest has but to
express his wishes here; my whole household is at
his command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know why I cannot go. I am afraid of
the other&mdash;Helga.&#8221; I paused before her name, and
she flushed when I used it.</p>

<p>&#8220;All Helga could be such a friend, if you would
let her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she has a very willing captive&mdash;how willing,
you do not seem to realize.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes and stood with bent head
for a moment in silence. Then she lifted it and
looked frankly into my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not have thought, now that I have seen
you, that you could be so hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I not rather say that to you? It is I
who am the conquered, you the conqueror. And you
laid claim to generosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not generous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you take all&mdash;all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you,&#8221; she said, shrinking a
little from my look.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the time comes you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when will it come?&#8221; The question was
eager.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost afraid to think,&#8221; I answered softly,
out of my inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better. The sooner the better,&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;You mystify me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And am I not mystified?&#8221; I glanced at the room
where M. Drexel sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can we not both speak plainly then?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>&#8220;We will see what to-morrow brings,&#8221; I said, and
held out my hand.</p>

<p>She made as if to carry it to her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am really loyal,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I who am the subject to-night. I am only
an American.&#8221; And as I spoke I captured her hand
and pressed my lips to it. &#8220;It is you, I say, who are
conqueror.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went up the broad stairway, leaving her looking
after me, smiling, and I thought triumphant; and I
hoped, pleased.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">&#8220;I AM NOT THE CZAR&#8221;</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE apartments to which I was shown were as
luxurious in their way as the room in which
I had been received, and as everything had obviously
been ready in advance, I had a shrewd suspicion that
Helga and Boreski had quite counted upon my remaining
in the house.</p>

<p>It was a queer position in all truth; and dismissing
the man who had been told to attend upon me, I
lit a cigar and sat down to think it out.</p>

<p>One thing was quite plain. Old Kalkov had been
fooled as to the objective of all the business. The
marriage of Boreski with the Duchess Stephanie was
a mere cover for the other scheme, and a very clever
cover too, seeing that it had looked so amazingly like
the sole end in view.</p>

<p>That was Helga&#8217;s wit; and to a point it had succeeded.
But where her plan had fallen to pieces was
in believing that the Emperor would be so mad as
to come and see her in his own august person. The
thing was so monstrously absurd that I was surprised
such sharp wits as hers had believed it possible and
had not suspected some imposture.</p>

<p>That I had not been instantly detected for a fraud
was indeed not the least curious feature: and I could
only conclude that having once persuaded themselves
to believe the thing possible, they were just in the
frame of mind which helped the self-deception.</p>

<p>Probably my idea of playing at being myself had
helped the deception, because it was naturally a part
I could keep up consistently. I had been myself with
occasional lapses into the Imperial imposture. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
that was all there was to it. What would happen when
the deception was discovered I could not even attempt
to anticipate.</p>

<p>The evening had effected a great change in myself.
The axis of everything had shifted. Helga&#8217;s personality
and plans had taken Boreski&#8217;s place; and whereas
I had been anxious to wipe out my old obligation to
the Emperor and had had a languid, very languid,
willingness to checkmate Boreski, my feelings now
were keenly enlisted in Helga&#8217;s behalf. Provided I
could arrange the affair of the compromising papers,
I was ready to throw myself heart and soul into her
cause.</p>

<p>I had already thrown my heart, indeed. She was
the most glorious woman I had ever met; and as
I sat back dreaming under the spell of her grace and
beauty and courage, I felt I would have given all
I had in the world to gain her confidence and help
her to win her end, whatever that might be.</p>

<p>Then I fell to wondering what could be the strange
secret that had led to her betrothal to that fat, squalid,
unctuous cad, Paul Drexel? What hold could he
have over her and over Boreski? What could possibly
have linked them together in that incongruous
partnership?</p>

<p>&#8220;How I hate that man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words rang in my ears as the sight of her
gloriously contemptuous indignation haunted my eyes.
What could make a woman of Helga&#8217;s courage and
man of Boreski&#8217;s daring&mdash;for daring he certainly
had&mdash;so afraid of a paltry common scoundrel as to
drive them to play at this betrothal?</p>

<p>Thank Heaven it was only playing. She would
never stoop to become the wife of a brute whom she
admitted she hated. Her heart was free if I could but
touch it; she was to be won if only I&mdash;and there
I sighed, recognizing the tremendous difficulties, and,
like a wise man, tossed the end of my cigar away and
got into bed, hoping that the night&#8217;s rest would enable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
me to pick out the master thread of the strangely
tangled skein.</p>

<p>I was up betimes and found my head clear on one
point.</p>

<p>There must be no more Emperor business, let the
result be what it would. I would tell Helga the
truth, even if the heavens fell; and I went down with
this purpose strong in me.</p>

<p>Then I would tell her of my friendship with the
Czar and offer my services as a direct intermediary
to bring about an interview between them.</p>

<p>She was in the garden among her flowers, and in
her simple morning costume, with the fresh colour
in her cheeks, she looked even lovelier than on the
previous night.</p>

<p>She welcomed me with a smile and held out some
flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an early riser, you see. I love my garden.
I have been out here more than an hour. You have
slept?&#8221; she added, glancing at my face which was
no doubt serious enough, for I rather dreaded what
I had to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never better in my life,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But I
wish to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And does that prospect make you so serious? I
ought to apologize for exhaling such terrors.&#8221; She
laughed gaily and bent over a flower bush, and then
glanced up half-coquettishly. &#8220;Let us wait a while.
Be merciful, and do not spoil my morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I have to say cannot wait, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I make a very bad listener when I am bending
from flower to flower, M. American. Unless it is
that you are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will depend on how you take my news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are not going at once,&#8221; she said quickly.
&#8220;Are not these lovely?&#8221; and she held up a bunch of
flowers for me to admire, and looked laughingly at
me over them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are as lovely as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I paused, looking
into her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she challenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hue of those blossoms rivals even that of
your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that an&mdash;an American form of compliment?
I do not care for compliments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My compliment was for the flower, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very pretty&mdash;but too Western to be Russian
monsieur. But come, we will go in. I am always
hungry in the mornings. Will you mind breakfasting
with me alone? M. Boreski is coming afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, to see him?&#8221; This with a gay little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, to breakfast with you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it will be practically alone. Madame Korvata,
excellent guardian and good soul that she is,
has reached the age which thinks more of what is
on the table than of those who are at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wish to speak to you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And keep me without my breakfast, monsieur!
And is that&mdash;American, too? I am far&mdash;far too
hungry to talk seriously or even to listen. Come;&#8221;
and she led the way into the house, laughing as she
went.</p>

<p>Thus at breakfast nothing could be said. Madame
Korvata, a small woman well into the fifties, with
large eyes and ample appetite, looked at me sharply
when I was presented to her, said that she had met
some pleasant Americans in her day and some very
unpleasant ones, and then seemed to forget all about
me in the more absorbing and profitable study of
breakfast.</p>

<p>Helga appeared desirous of impressing even on
the servants that I was an American, for she talked
chiefly of my country, and seemed to take a delight
in putting intricate and searching questions. That
I answered them so easily caused her constant astonishment
and some amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;How well you know your country, monsieur,&#8221;
she said with a glance and a lift of the brows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>&#8220;It should not be surprising,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet it is&mdash;very. You appear to know it as
well as&mdash;as Europe or even Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I explained last night that my father was a diplomatist,
and I had advantages as a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how deftly you turn things. You might have
been trained in a Court and picked up the facility
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shooting of these little shafts amused her intensely,
and the meal was punctuated with her laughter
and sallies.</p>

<p>When it was over she led me to the garden, and
then excused herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I manage all my matters myself. I shall not be
long, and then shall be at your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see you as soon as possible,&#8221; I said as
she went off and Madame Korvata came out of the
house smoking her cigarette. I lit a cigar, and the
old lady waited and then said abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your face, monsieur. You are like our
Emperor. But how did you come to know Helga?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was very simple, but yet embarrassing;
and when I hesitated how to reply, she saw it and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t answer unless you like. I hate bothersome
questions myself, and never press them. I always
pretend never to hear them, indeed. A deaf ear saves
a lot of trouble. You think Helga pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is far more than pretty; she is
beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady smiled at my enthusiasm, and took
a couple of puffs at her cigarette while she looked
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, they all say that, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All, madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And good, too,&#8221; she continued, pretending not to
hear my question. &#8220;Good, too. A big kind heart&mdash;and
such a brain. Ah, she would be a great woman
if she had her rights. She would make a noble wife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
monsieur, a noble wife; but&mdash;she will never marry&mdash;that
is until she has them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very fond of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody is. She is more than a daughter to
me. Without her I should be&mdash;do you know the
fate of destitute old women in Russia? God help
them, for the Government don&#8217;t. Helga does God&#8217;s
part for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think she will never marry, madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced up with another of her slow, shrewd
smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get her her rights, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused.
&#8220;She is affianced, but I know what I think.&#8221; She
shook her head gravely. &#8220;But no one can do it.
So they come and go&mdash;and always go at last, not
to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not encourage her to talk about Helga&#8217;s
matters, and I smoked in silence, thinking over what
had dropped from her; and when Helga returned,
Madame Korvata went into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has the sweetest nature,&#8221; said Helga; &#8220;but
I suppose she has been warning you. She always
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warning me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has one regret&mdash;that I do not marry. She
thinks that marriage is the only proper climax for
a woman&#8217;s life, and that whenever any one comes
here, they come with that idea; and she always warns
them that I shall never marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She suggested you might be influenced by material
reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That if any man succeeded in getting you your
rights, you would look upon him with very different
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face changed on the instant from amused
astonishment to thoughtful and intense earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak of what you do not know, monsieur,
and will not hear. There is nothing that could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
demanded of me, no sacrifice however complete or
ruinous, no danger however deadly, I would not face
for that. That is my real life&mdash;all else is a mere
setting and pretence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I speak to you now&mdash;without interruption?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you prefer to be here or in the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all one to me if you will listen seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us speak here; it is my favourite walk.&#8221;
And we turned into the broad path circling a fountain
and surrounded by flower beds abundantly filled and
carefully tended. &#8220;Now, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the night I thought over all the strange
situation, and this morning came to a decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be of course a decision one way or
the other,&#8221; she put in when I paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will understand that before I came here I had
no idea I was to meet you. I expected to have to
deal only with M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was part of my intention. In that I misled
you, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing compared to the deception I have
practised upon you; and I can only plead the excuse
that I should not have done it under any inducements
had I known of you. Please believe that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deception? How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the Emperor, mademoiselle; I am only
what I have asked you to regard me&mdash;a plain American
citizen, Harper C. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she was astonished at my confession or angry
at it, she gave no sign of either feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a very serious confession,&#8221; she said, speaking
very slowly. &#8220;Very serious. <i>When</i> did you decide
to make it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning, realizing the present <i>impasse</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very ingenious, at any rate.&#8221; Her tone was
sarcastic now. &#8220;It did not occur to you to speak of
such a&mdash;such a trifle last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was still no anger in the glance she gave me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frankly, I was too overwhelmed for the time by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the possible consequences. But this morning I saw
that the truth was at once the simplest and best way
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The necessity for the&mdash;truth was a little late in
emphasizing itself, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so to you, no doubt; but I was on the
horns of a very awkward dilemma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Prince Kalkov?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he knows it. I came at his instigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you are really an American, and were
in Russia as a boy, with your father a diplomatist;
and you have been in Germany and France, and speak
the languages without any of that horrible English
accent; and you understand Russian; and you came
here from the Palace; and were driven to the Palace
the other evening, having been received with a guard
of honour; and you are the living image of our
Emperor. Do you know the Emperor, M. American?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said it all with such unmistakably good-humoured
disbelief that when she had recourse to the
term she had freely used the previous night, I could
not refrain from smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Emperor has done me the honour to make
me his friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very fortunate, M.&mdash;let me see, what
is the name&mdash;M. Harper C. Denver,&#8221; she replied
with a gay laugh. &#8220;You are also an excellent actor,
having picked up many little gestures of the Emperor
himself. It is really a most wonderful coincidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The reception at the railway station was planned
by Prince Kalkov, who knew of my coming and had
heard from His Majesty of the strange resemblance
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Prince Kalkov is more subtle than I thought
him. Well then, M. American, what do you propose
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and looked me full in the face with a
smiling challenge. It was plain as the Statue of Liberty
that she didn&#8217;t believe a word of my explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>&#8220;I wish to discuss the situation with you frankly.
I wish you to believe that what I now say is absolutely
true; and further, if you will accept them, to place my
services for what they are worth entirely at your disposal.
I would do anything to serve you and to atone
in some way for this deception of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me what is impossible,&#8221; she answered
readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You decline my assistance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I cannot believe your explanation&mdash;your
confession, as you termed it. I cannot; oh, I cannot;&#8221;
and she laughed and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only repeat it is the truth,&#8221; I said seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be very frank with you and show you how
it strikes me. You act it now quite as cleverly as you
acted the Emperor last night. You will recall your
little slips into the Imperial character; your manner
in dealing with M. Boreski, and again with M. Drexel.
Well, you find that to go away from here would compel
me to deal with the compromising papers&mdash;and
in that I was and am entirely in earnest; nothing can
move me&mdash;and then you think by admitting this deception
you can gain indirectly what you naturally
want and cannot get directly&mdash;that is, time. I speak
very bluntly, I fear, but this is so much to me that I
must do so. And I tell you this second move has
failed as signally as your first last night. I ask you
to retract your&mdash;confession, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We seem to be getting deeper into the maze.
What I have told you this morning is the truth,
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put a test to you. Will you hear my
story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you will pass me your word that you believe
what I have said this morning. I could not hear
you last night, because I could not accept your confidence
in my false character of Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You agree and then put an impossible condition.
You have an intimate knowledge of the ways of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Russian Court and diplomacy. I ask again then, what
do you propose to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My intention was to go to the Emperor and gain
for you the audience you wish. I think I could do
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And meanwhile the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you would hold your hand at least until
I had tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Emperor would not hear me in this
house, what chance would there be of his doing so
elsewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not the Emperor, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me you are, monsieur, and will continue to be;
so that if you leave here, I shall assuredly do what I
said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are at the <i>impasse</i> again, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you who cause it,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see no other way out of it than that I have
suggested;&#8221; and as she made no reply, we walked
round and round the fountain in silence.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the sound of a galloping
horse, and presently a man, top-booted and travel-stained,
hurried from the house towards us.</p>

<p>&#8220;From M. Boreski, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said in Russian,
handing her a letter.</p>

<p>She tore it open, and a newspaper cutting dropped
from it, which I picked up and held out to her.</p>

<p>She read the letter quickly, started, paled slightly,
and then glanced at me, her expression a mixture of
excitement and amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you read what you have there? It is from a
paper just issued.&#8221;</p>

<p>I read it, and could not refrain from a smile on my
part. It was very short and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Slight indisposition of the Emperor.&mdash;We regret
to learn at the moment of going to press that His
Majesty is suffering from a slight chill, and, acting
under medical advice, will remain in his room to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
We have the highest authority for saying that the
indisposition is very slight indeed, and at most will
keep him indoors for a couple of days. This announcement
is necessary to allay any anxiety on the
part of the public owing to his inability to review the
troops in person to-day, as had been arranged. There
is no doubt, however, that he will entirely have recovered
by the time of the Crown Prince of Sweden&#8217;s
visit three days hence.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Helga was waiting for my eyes as I finished, and
when she saw my smile, answered with a lift of the
brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;A singular coincidence, M. American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More probably cause and effect. Prince Kalkov
has told His Majesty, and this is for your further
mystification, and to prevent the deception being discovered
through the Emperor&#8217;s presence at the review
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think with you there is cause and effect,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;Do you still keep to your&mdash;confession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the truth, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that you will find it as difficult to
persuade others as to persuade me. And in that lies
the danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face clouded, and she tapped the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is from M. Boreski, and concerns you
closely. You must read it for yourself. It is a
further complication.&#8221;</p>

<p>A further complication it was in all seriousness, as
a glance at the letter showed me.</p>

<p>It threatened indeed just a devil of a mess.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">DEEPER IN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BORESKI&#8217;S letter ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have just heard very disturbing news, and hasten
to send it you, while I go to make inquiries. Drexel
and I had a somewhat serious quarrel after leaving
your house last night; very hot words passed between
us on the subject of M. Denver&#8217;s visit, and we parted
after some vague threats on his side, to which I paid
no very great heed. But this morning I learn from
Vattel&mdash;whose information is, as you know, generally
reliable&mdash;that Drexel saw Vastic and some of
those with him, and has told them who M. Denver
really is. You will understand what is likely to happen
at any moment, therefore, if your visitor is not
protected. I trust in God that all is well up to now.
All sorts of consequences are possible, and you should
act at once. It would be absolutely fatal to all concerned
if anything were to happen at your house;
and my advice to you is either to let M. Denver return
home the instant you receive this or to leave the
villa with him and go secretly to Brabinsk. Precautions
can be much more easily taken there, and, more
over, no one will then know where to look for you.
But for God&#8217;s sake act promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The enclosed is from the just issued <i>Journal</i>, and
shows how the Court people are covering M. Denver&#8217;s
absence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall seek you as soon as I have definite news;
but unfortunately there is little room to doubt the
gravity of things.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;L. B.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>&#8220;This means?&#8221; I asked when I had read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Nihilists, monsieur.&#8221; Helga&#8217;s tone was firm
and deliberate. &#8220;Vastic is the name of one of the
leaders of the extremists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean of the assassins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the most reckless of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My present scheme has failed,&#8221; she replied, still
calmly. &#8220;I must begin again; but I shall have proved
my strength and I shall be revenged. M. Boreski is
right. You had better leave at once. I would not have
anything happen here for all the wealth of Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not the Emperor,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Need we play that sorry farce any longer? You
had better go&mdash;and without an instant&#8217;s delay, monsieur.
Come, let us order the carriage;&#8221; and she
started towards the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the papers?&#8221; I asked, following her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand is forced by this. I shall use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, what a mess!&#8221; I cried involuntarily.</p>

<p>She paid no heed, but hurried me into the house,
and gave orders for a carriage to be brought round
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ready of course, monsieur,&#8221; she said
quickly.</p>

<p>But I had made up my mind. Her fear of &#8220;something
happening&#8221; had given me a cue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going, mademoiselle, without the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go, monsieur,&#8221; she replied, her face setting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I take the papers with me, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, monsieur, you will go without
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see;&#8221; and I sat down with an intentional
deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have pledged myself for your personal safety.
You must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The purpose in her voice strengthened with every
sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>&#8220;I will trust to my own right arm, mademoiselle.
Without those papers, I do not leave the house, come
what may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are dealing with a desperate woman, monsieur.
You must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then give me the papers to take with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came and stood opposite me, her eyes aflame,
and her hands clenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall go if we have to use force to take you
away;&#8221; and she moved away and laid her finger on
the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not do that, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she cried, turning round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the man who seeks to lay hands on me
will touch nothing else in this life.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute she stood silent in distracted hesitation.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the sound of the carriage
wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see,&#8221; she cried, and pressed the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please;&#8221; and I rose and stepped back
against the wall and drew my revolver.</p>

<p>At the sight of it she closed her eyes and threw up
her hands with a cry of fear and anguish, and then
clasped her hands to her head.</p>

<p>The servant came in then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the carriage there, Peter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went and closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty, I beg you for the love of God to
go and save your life. Ah, do, do!&#8221; she cried
distractedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the Emperor, mademoiselle; and without
the papers I cannot and will not go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came nearer to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg and entreat of you. If you are caught here,
think what will happen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no discretion to think in such a case,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
answered firmly, although the sight of her suffering
wrung my heart.</p>

<p>Almost before the words were out of my mouth
she sprang forward in a wild attempt to seize my
revolver. But I had been in too many tight corners
in my life to be taken unawares, totally unexpected
though the man&#339;uvre was, and I wrenched my hand
away and held her harmless with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is worse than madness, mademoiselle!&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>She gave up the contest then, and drawing away,
fell into a lounge in an attitude of despair.</p>

<p>I had won the victory, but the fruits were too bitter.
I put the revolver away in my pocket and crossed to
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give me the papers?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I will die first, and so shall you! Oh God,
how hard you are! I wish I had never seen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will go with you to Brabinsk, and we can
settle things there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose at once and shook off her emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where I go is of no consequence to any one. I
have to convince you of your mistake. I will go to
Brabinsk. I have to save you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no secret purpose in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that fair? If you need it, I give you my word of
honour to act exactly as you wish&mdash;except in regard
to those papers. I am resolved they shall not be
used.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will be missed. You cannot stay away.
You&mdash;oh, this is madness, too, surely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wasting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought quickly; then smiled bitterly and shook
her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur, thank you. I do not walk open-eyed
into a trap, however cleverly laid. You know I
must take the papers with me, and reckon to get them
by the way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>&#8220;That is a suspicion worthy perhaps of&mdash;M.
Drexel. I do not thank you for it. I am not such
a mean cad. But that you may feel safe, you can
travel alone in the carriage and I will ride with, say,
M. Boreski&#8217;s messenger or any one you can trust to
guide me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for what I said. I do not think it;
indeed I do not, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not much time for explanations, mademoiselle.
We must act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might not be safe for you to be with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will put it that way if you like,&#8221; I said with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you make such a hateful insinuation
when I repent and retract my words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We seem fated to misunderstand each other. But
shall we do as I say? Order saddle horses, and I will
take steps to prevent any one believing they can recognize
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan could guide you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then send Peter at once to my room. I will be
ready in a few minutes;&#8221; and without waiting for
more I hurried away.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes Peter had shaved off my
beard and moustache, and had found me from somewhere
a riding jacket. I ran down, and was fastening
my cloak across the saddle of the horse that was to
carry me, when Helga came out, dressed ready for
the drive.</p>

<p>She started on seeing the change in me, and at first
scarcely seemed to recognize me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not have thought so simple a thing would
make such a difference in your looks,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready to start, mademoiselle,&#8221; was my answer;
and I swung myself into the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been very quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for you I am anxious. Au revoir. Now
Ivan;&#8221; and without waiting for more, I clapped the
heels into my horse and cantered off. I looked back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
as I rounded a bend in the avenue, and saw that
Madame Korvata had joined Helga, and that they
were getting into the carriage.</p>

<p>Ivan rode up to me as we came out upon the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the right, if you please, your honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked along the road in the opposite direction
somewhat anxiously, but his face cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to travel fast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be best for a few miles, your
honour,&#8221; he said, and accordingly we whipped along
at a smart pace until the suburbs of the city were left
well behind. Then he struck through a number of
by-roads, until I was utterly at sea as to our whereabouts,
except that by the sun I could tell we were
travelling north; and we fell into a walking pace on
reaching a very steep zig-zag hill.</p>

<p>Ivan was a fine sturdy fellow, with a strong, very
intelligent face, and he sat his horse with consummate
skill. I liked his looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in the army?&#8221; I said, letting him
come to my side as we mounted the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a Cossack regiment, your honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And prefer private service, no doubt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a good mistress, your honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought you were M. Boreski&#8217;s servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are Mademoiselle Helga&#8217;s animals, your
honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had noticed before that all about her spoke of her
either as mademoiselle or Mademoiselle Helga, and
never used any surname.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are two good horses and in magnificent
condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am responsible for the stables, your honour,&#8221;
he said with a pleased smile at the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is Brabinsk?&#8221; I asked him next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty versts by the road the carriage will take&mdash;about
twenty-six by this road, your honour; but
the horses could do twice the distance easily.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>&#8220;So far is it? I did not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>We rode on in silence, and I noticed him directing
curious sidelong glances at me now and then, until
at last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your honour&#8217;s pardon, but your honour is not
Russian?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had been speaking Russian, and this had betrayed
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am an American,&#8221; I answered with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your honour has crossed the sea. I have
never seen the sea. I have heard of America. And
so you have political troubles there, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We call them Tammany there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word puzzled him greatly, and he repeated it
several times gravely, shaking his head over the
pronunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the same as Nihilism?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; I replied, and attempted a brief description
of Tammany Hall and its methods. Either
my description was vague or his understanding of
it imperfect, for his face took on an expression of
disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an awful country, your honour; what
tyranny! I am glad I am not an American. Yet
after all one&#8217;s own country is best, I suppose, and it
must be sad to be an exile.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone and glance were quite pitying now. He
regarded me apparently as an exile.</p>

<p>I began to be amused at him, and drew out some
of his views on Russia. The result surprised me.
He was an intense and indeed a passionate patriot,
but he hated the Russian Government. The Czar, as
the God-appointed head of Russia, was a quite sacred
person, a sort of Fetish in his eyes; but the ministers
round him were as the incarnation of evil. For the
Little Father it was the heaven-ordained duty of every
good Russian to lay down his life willingly and instantly;
while he seemed to suggest that it would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
almost equally meritorious to take the lives of those
who did evil and ground the people in his name.</p>

<p>I looked for the key to this queer mixture of political
faiths in the man&#8217;s association with Helga, and knowledge
of her wrongs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very devoted to Mademoiselle Helga?&#8221;
I asked presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;My life is hers if ever she should need it, your
honour,&#8221; he answered readily, simply and very earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good fellow, Ivan,&#8221; I said; and soon
after that we rattled on again at the canter. As we
rode, he evidently thought over what had passed between
us, for when we drew rein again he came up
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave your honour&#8217;s pardon, but was it your
honour who came last night to mademoiselle&#8217;s villa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am mystified, your honour. It was you then
whom M. Boreski bound me by all I hold sacred to
guard with my life. And yet you are an American&mdash;a
stranger&mdash;an exile. He told me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and shook his head in perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I was to serve your honour as if you were
the Little Father himself; God keep him; that there
was danger from the desperado Vastic; that I should
probably have to guide you by by-ways to the Palace
from the villa. And yet you are an American. I am
filled with wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I look like an American, Ivan?&#8221; I asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your honour has shaved since I first saw you.
Then I thought you were the&mdash;&mdash; I trembled at
your look, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had I been what you thought, you looked for
danger then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God would have given me strength to protect
His Majesty. I am mystified; but it is not for me to
ask questions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>&#8220;You know this Vastic, then?&#8221; I asked next.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a good man, absolutely sincere, your&mdash;your
honour,&#8221; he fumbled now over the way he should address
me, and his manner had changed from frankness
to nervous excitement. &#8220;Quite sincere; but a
madman on one point; and his madness makes him
dangerous and reckless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fanatic you mean against the Government?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against the Emperor. We have fought once for
that, and he nearly killed me. But we shall fight
again, and then I shall win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fate, your honour; and, besides, I have
practised.&#8221;</p>

<p>The combination of fatalism and deliberate preparation
tickled me, and I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you were afraid for my life then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yours only, your honour, not yours only; but
mademoiselle and M. Boreski&#8217;s also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle&#8217;s?&#8221; I cried with a start. &#8220;How
and why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave your&mdash;your honour&#8217;s pardon, but I may
not speak of my mistress&#8217;s affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am her friend as staunchly as you can be, Ivan;
and if you can tell me anything without speaking of
her private affairs, do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought for a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only what I myself fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can surely tell me,&#8221; I said eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your&mdash;your honour had been what I thought,
and not an American only, Vastic&#8217;s anger and that
of those with him would have fallen on mademoiselle
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so plain, your honour. He would have held
it such treachery for&mdash;for such a one to have been
at the villa and to have left it unharmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; I cried as the light burst upon me.
&#8220;You mean they would condemn the mademoiselle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and M. Boreski for not having taken my life when
apparently they had the chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your honour can surely see that clearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the full danger and possible horror of the thing
rushed upon me, I dashed my heels into my horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then, for God&#8217;s sake! Let us get to her
and see that she is safe,&#8221; I cried, and we covered
the remaining miles as fast as the gallant beasts under
us could travel. And gallantly they carried us; up
hill and down, without let or stop we rattled along,
Ivan to the full as eager and urgent as I, until we
reached Brabinsk and drew up before the door of a
secluded house lying away from any road. I dismounted
from my sweating, panting horse, and asked
for Helga.</p>

<p>She had not arrived, and we were quite unexpected;
but at a few words from Ivan I was admitted, and
he led the horses away to the stables.</p>

<p>I was too anxious to remain in the house, and as
soon as I had washed and removed the traces of the
reckless ride from my clothes, I went out to the gate
and waited with a feverish impatience for signs of
her coming.</p>

<p>The thought of the danger into which she had
plunged maddened me; and I breathed a fervent
thanksgiving when at length I caught sight of the
carriage.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">HELGA SPEAKS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THANK God, you are safe,&#8221; I cried as I
assisted Helga from the carriage, my pent-up
anxiety making my tone intensely earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe? I?&#8221; and she looked at me in astonishment.
&#8220;Why, has anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am excited. Ivan has told <i>me</i> of your danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Ivan must be taught how to hold his tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I drew it from him, mademoiselle. I made him
tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not have asked <i>me</i> about my own
affairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not question him about your affairs, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my supposed danger is not my affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why play with words? You must explain everything
to me. I must know all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must?&#8221; with a lift of the brows. &#8220;Your ride
seems to have made you strangely impatient. Can
you restrain it while I take off my hat, monsieur?
I am hungry, too, after my ride. Are not you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in a fever to know all, and that&#8217;s the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must lecture Ivan for exciting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you to say nothing to that good fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that you look much more American
now that you are clean shaven, and seem to act up
better to the part! But you must not take my breath
away;&#8221; and with a laugh she left me.</p>

<p>If there was really the danger of which Ivan had
spoken, Helga certainly took it very calmly. But
I could not be calm, and I paced up and down the
room fuming and imagining many evil possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
for half an hour, until a servant came to usher me
to another room, where a meal was laid and Helga
with Madame Korvata were awaiting me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if we are all going to die in ten minutes,
we may as well have something to eat first,&#8221; said
Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering the surprise and no notice, they
haven&#8217;t done badly, Helga,&#8221; declared Madame
Korvata critically, looking at the well-spread table.
&#8220;What a blessing it is that when one reaches the
age which appreciates the importance of food, one
has good food to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sighed, and Helga smiled at my impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you invited yourself to Brabinsk, monsieur,
I will not apologize for so impromptu a meal,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A crust of bread and a glass of water would be
more than enough for me in my present mood,&#8221; I
answered restlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your digestion bad, monsieur?&#8221; inquired
Madame Korvata sympathetically. &#8220;At your age
you ought to be able to eat anything. You look
well and strong too; I should never have thought it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I enjoy excellent health, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s made a great change in your looks, monsieur.
You are not so much like the Emperor now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen the Emperor without his
beard, Aunt Korvata?&#8221; asked Helga, with a glance
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear. I&#8217;ve only seen him once. I was
judging, like most people, by his portraits. You have
never seen him very close, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often wished to,&#8221; returned Helga, with
another glance. But my restlessness was so insistent
that this lightness jarred upon me, and I remained
almost moodily silent until the end of a meal that
seemed unendurably wearisome. I was consumed with
my anxiety to question Helga about Vastic&mdash;her
Nihilistic associates and her connexion with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>&#8220;Can I speak to you alone, at once, mademoiselle?&#8221;
I said as we rose from the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The answer came after a pause which
made me think she was going to put me off. We
went into the room where I had first been shown.
&#8220;I have not been at Brabinsk for some time and
wish to see to certain things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to detain you, but I cannot wait.
I wish you to tell me the nature of your and M.
Boreski&#8217;s relations with this man Vastic and his
associates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, then, you <i>are</i> interested in part of my story&mdash;that
part which you think might bring me under
suspicion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t let us fence with words.
I am too anxious. You know that you are doing
me a gross injustice in saying such a thing, and that
my sole motive is concern for you&mdash;you yourself,
and the danger which may threaten you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earnestness of my manner made her earnest too.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I swear it; because you can read it
in my acts. You must feel it; I am sure you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She met my eyes, and seemed to understand some
of the passion that I felt was glowing in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are incomprehensible, monsieur,&#8221; and her
eyes fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must see how I feel. Is it true that because
you harboured last night a man whom you believed
to be the Emperor, you are likely to be in danger from
these reckless fanatics? That question has been burning
in my brain ever since the suggestion was prompted
by Ivan&#8217;s words. Is that to be the terrible consequence
of this hapless, ill-conceived visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was I who planned the visit, monsieur. Do
you think I should not foresee any possible consequences?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, it&#8217;s true then!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;How
could you be so mad, so blind, so reckless?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>&#8220;Blind I was not; reckless you have made me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Prince Kalkov and your advisers, monsieur,
if you prefer that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not the Emperor, mademoiselle,&#8221; I cried
angrily. &#8220;That is what I mean. You have incurred
this fearful risk for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have said so already, many times, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tossed up my hands in despair and began to stride
up and down the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be an end to this,&#8221; I cried sharply.
&#8220;I must find some means of making you believe
the truth.&#8221;</p>



<p>She rose and came to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were in such danger as you think, would
you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me how and test me.&#8221; She looked long
and anxiously in my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are sweet words to hear,&#8221; she said, with
a smile and a note of triumph.</p>

<p>I took her hands, and she left them in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all about these men, and let us together
see what is best to do. The thought of your danger
maddens me, Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will listen to me now&mdash;hear all I have to
say; and then help me in the one purpose of my
life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will help you, God knows, loyally in everything&mdash;in
everything; but I cannot give you the kind of
help you seek, because I am not the man you believe.
You must not give me your confidence while you hold
to that mistaken belief.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was going to protest again&mdash;I read it in her
eyes&mdash;but, instead, she paused, and then asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I care not what you are, will you listen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Readily, readily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you then,&#8221; she said in a low tone, as
she withdrew her hands from mine gently. &#8220;I am
Helga Lavalski.&#8221; She looked for some token of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
recognition of the name from me, as she had on the
previous night, and when she saw none her face
clouded, and she passed her hand across her eyes
as if in pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do not recognize the name, it is for the
reason I have given you. Until you spoke it last
night, I had never heard of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not possible,&#8221; she said in low accents of
pain. Then, after a pause, she lifted her eyes and
continued: &#8220;If it must be so, we will pretend that;
but the time was when Boris Lavalski was the chosen
friend of&mdash;of His Majesty, and when the name was
oftenest on his lips. They were almost as brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better tell me all in your own way,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is barely seven years ago that the change came
which parted them&mdash;a change due to the man I will
name presently. My father stood in that man&#8217;s path:
the one was honest, the other a villain: and by
villainous, underhand, infamous methods a charge of
treason was laid and proved by perjured liars suborned
by the arch-conspirator. You will remember the
Nihilist plot at the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not, but it was no use interrupting her to
repeat my ignorance of the whole affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A truer and more loyal servant the Emperor
never had, but his ears were poisoned; the apparent
proofs of an assassination plot were laid before him;
a trap had been set for my father, and by it he
was ruined. He was kidnapped and held a secret
prisoner; the tale being spread that he had fled the
country; and in his absence the decree of banishment
was signed. As foul a crime as was ever
committed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the proofs of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the worst. By an even fouler stroke
an order for his execution as a Nihilist was obtained.
Many men were put to death at that fearful time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and one of the orders with a name written in pencil
was signed by the Emperor. This name was afterwards
erased and my father&#8217;s substituted; and then
another lying tale was carried to the Emperor that a
mistake had been made and my father had been put
to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven, what consummate infamy!&#8221; I exclaimed.
&#8220;But the proofs of this! What and where
are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was scarcely more than a child at the time,
barely eighteen, but I was included in the scheme.
I should have been arrested had not my friends hidden
me and then hurried me from the country. Otherwise,
I should have gone to Siberia. As it was, I
was proscribed and banished, and all our possessions
were seized in the name of the Emperor. Do you
wonder if I live but for revenge?&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, but I made no comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took up the task eagerly. Two years afterwards
I returned to Russia in another name, and, girl as
I was, I set myself patiently to hunt down the powerful
minister who had planned this crime and risen
upon it to higher honours. Bit by bit, a fraction here,
a fraction there, I collected the proofs, working always
secretly, until a stroke of fortune came my way, and
a witness, who had been first a tool and then a victim
of the same powerful villain, laid the whole truth
bare to me. Meanwhile, by the death of a relative,
I had become once more rich, and could pay well
all who helped me and promise them protection. It
was a terrible life for a young girl, monsieur, and in
those few years I lived a lifetime. But I had gained
what I sought, the proofs and witnesses to support
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Triumph as well as anger was in the look she gave
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I set myself then to gain your&mdash;to gain the
Emperor&#8217;s ear and to get my father&#8217;s case re-opened.
But there I was baffled by the man who stood between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
me and him. I had to fly the country, or my fate
would have been as my father&#8217;s had been; and those
who worked for me were no match for this man&#8217;s
power and vigilance and cunning. I would not accept
failure, and I returned to Russia secretly to seek some
other avenue, and at that crisis I met M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you better tell me his affairs?&#8221; I asked
warningly, but she waved the warning aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am telling you everything. He is an exiled Pole&mdash;Count
Primus Noveschkoff&mdash;and for his part in
a Polish plot he was exiled and beggared. He is a
great violinist, and I saw my way when I learnt that
the Duchess Stephanie had become enamoured of him
and he of her, strange as that may seem to you, who
know her age and lack of personal charms. I helped
him to secure her for his wife for I knew the Court
would eventually pardon and ennoble him, and that
through her I could eventually gain the Emperor&#8217;s
ear. The obstacles to such a match were of course
countless, but I was not daunted, and you know the
scheme that I laid&mdash;to gain the papers we have obtained&mdash;and
how it has fared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And M. Paul Drexel?&#8221; Her face clouded at the
question, and she paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you once before I would do anything
to gain my end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how comes such a man to be on the scene
at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are interested then in the story I have had
to force upon you?&#8221; she asked with one of her searching,
half-triumphant, half-defiant glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am intensely interested in this part of your
story,&#8221; I answered earnestly. &#8220;What is he really to
you? How comes he here? Do you mean that you
would marry such a man, despising him as you do,
to gain your purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>My string of questions, and the vehemence with
which I asked them, seemed to please her, for she
smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>&#8220;I would do even that&mdash;if it were necessary. He
has forced himself upon us, and his silence on certain
things&mdash;why should I not tell you, I have told you
all,&#8221; she broke off. &#8220;I have trusted you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew M. Boreski&#8217;s real character and past,
and it was in his power to checkmate everything by
denouncing him to the Government. He had to be
silenced, and his price was&mdash;the promise of my hand.
I paid it, only thankful he made it so light and did
not insist on an immediate marriage. I should have
married him&mdash;then;&#8221; she dropped her voice at the
last word and paused before it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; I asked, my own voice a fraction
unsteady.</p>

<p>She waited before replying, and then looking up
frankly said, after an interval, in her usual calm
tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not now be necessary. You know my
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence that followed was very embarrassing
to me. It was clear she still insisted upon believing
I was the Czar. It was in that belief she had spoken,
and it was because of that same belief that she and
Boreski had been led to break with the man on the
previous night. She was so confident the mere recital
of her wrongs to me&mdash;as the Emperor&mdash;would
secure the justice, to obtain which was the passionate
desire of her life, that I knew how bitter the truth
would be when it was forced upon her. It was just
an awful mess, and I sighed involuntarily. She looked
up in quick questioning perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am looking for some sign from you,&#8221; she said
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not told me of this man Vastic and
his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no Nihilist, monsieur, but I have not hesitated
to ally myself with them and to use them. They
could obtain certain kinds of information which I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
helpless to gain without them, and I was glad to have
their help. Indeed, I was compelled to have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God! and didn&#8217;t you see the danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has my life been so even that I need fear an
added risk or two? I have helped them in my turn
with money&mdash;thousands and thousands of roubles I
have given them.&#8221; Then, with a quick change to
fierceness: &#8220;Why did the Government make me an
enemy? Why deny me my justice? Why destroy
my father and seek to destroy me? Why refuse to
hear me? If it was to be war between us, was I to
be tender-handed in the weapons I used? Place yourself
in my position, monsieur, and say what you would
have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not have turned Nihilist,&#8221; I answered
firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor did I. I am as loyal to the Throne as any
woman in Russia. If I were a Nihilist, would you
be alive now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not accusing you. I am thinking of your
present danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger!&#8221; she cried contemptuously. &#8220;I should
despise myself if I sat down to count every shadow
of danger that crossed my path. Live a life such
as mine and you will come to laugh at dangers as
I do. Nothing, no not even the instant prospect
of death itself, should stand, or ever has stood, between
me and my purpose. Could I have done what
I have had I been one of your timid mouse-scared
women?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked glorious in her proud repudiation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, we may as well sound the depths of it,&#8221; I
said practically. &#8220;Does Vastic know who you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has this Drexel any suspicion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have;&#8221; the reply was given with a contemptuous
shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;To repeat my former question, if Vastic believes
you had the Emperor in your house and allowed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
to leave, would he be likely to regard that as an
offence against the brotherhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And punishable&mdash;how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might decree my death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, and you speak of danger so calmly,&#8221;
I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger can always be faced, and generally met
and overcome, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her courage was dauntless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Drexel know of this place&mdash;Brabinsk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. But he is a spy by nature, and may
have found it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would surely tell Vastic and the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, no; probably, or possibly, yes. There
are limits even to the courage of his baseness.&#8221; She
paused, and then added, &#8220;If he thought you were
here, he might do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat thinking intently, distressed and baffled by
the knowledge of the dangers among which she moved.
She waited for me to speak, and gradually an expression
of dismay and pain clouded her features. She
was looking for some sign from me, as Emperor,
that I would help her to the object always foremost
in her thoughts. And receiving none, the belief that
she had got her story to me and had yet failed to gain
the Imperial protection, chilled and hardened her. And
well it might, forsooth.</p>

<p>I was too stunned by the enormous difficulties on
all sides to see what to do or say.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose, her manner half-anxious appeal
and half-veiled threat as she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who ruined my father was your confidential
adviser and his former friend, Prince Kalkov.
If you feel that he is too valuable to you, you will
probably do nothing and leave me to deal with those
papers as I will. But I beg your&mdash;I beg you, monsieur,
to think, if not of my father and my wrongs,
at least to consider what it may mean to Russia. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
an hour doubtless you will be able to decide and leave
Brabinsk. And remember, oh remember, how I have
trusted you and how much I have built upon this
interview.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting to hear the protest that sprang
to my lips she left the room.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter X</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">VASTIC</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was dusk when our interview ended, and lighting
a cigar I stepped out through the window
into the gardens to think.</p>

<p>The tragic and unutterably sorrowful story which
Helga had told me had filled the cup of my sympathy
with her to overflowing, and help her I vowed
I would in some way. But she herself made that
help extremely difficult to plan. If I left the place
without giving her some pledge in my false character
as Emperor, she would instantly make use of
those papers, and thus shut the last door upon the
chance of his doing anything.</p>

<p>There was the possibility that if I were to give her
some such pledge I might afterwards be able to get
her the interview with the real Emperor that she
desired. But so much further deceit and lying would
be involved that I ruled out the idea at once.</p>

<p>There was also one other feeble way&mdash;to get some
communication to the Emperor, telling him the whole
thing, and leaving him to act. But while such a plan
might possibly do good, it was much more likely to
do harm. Prince Kalkov would be immediately consulted&mdash;and
then the deluge. It was more than
probable, indeed, that any message or communication
from me would be intercepted by him. So that notion
had to go after the other.</p>

<p>Helga&#8217;s stubborn refusal to believe that I was no
more than just a private individual was of course
the bed rock of the mess, and nothing that I had said
or done had shaken her belief in the least. Nothing
seemed likely to do it, moreover, short of getting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Emperor to stand shoulder to shoulder with me so
that she might see us together.</p>

<p>There was, further, the to me unendurable risk
of leaving her alone at Brabinsk to face the danger
from these wretched Nihilist fanatics. Had the other
parts of the problem been capable of solution, that
alone would have kept me by her side.</p>

<p>Of all the tests to which a man&#8217;s nerve may be
subjected, few can be more terrible than the fear of
secret assassination. But there is one, and I ran up
against it there. To know that there are a number
of human wild beasts planning to put a bullet in your
head or a knife in your heart is bad enough, but it
is infinitely worse when you feel, as I did, that if they
failed to do that for me they would probably endeavour
to do it for the woman I loved.</p>

<p>And thus I paced the lawn in a mood of intense
embarrassment, complicated with a double fear for
my own life and for Helga&#8217;s.</p>

<p>With that thought in my mind I had a good look
round the house. It was, as Boreski had said in his
letter, a good place for taking precautions. A square
solid stone building, with all the lower windows protected
by bars or heavy shutters, and it would be as
difficult to break into it as to get out of it.</p>

<p>In my mood then I had a keen appreciation of its
strength, and I came back to the front again feeling
very thankful to the man who had planned and
built it.</p>

<p>It was a dead still evening. The twilight had faded
very quickly, and when I had been smoking and
worrying myself for about an hour, without getting
an inch nearer to any solution of the problem Helga
had set me, my ears, which are very keen, caught a
sound in the distance.</p>

<p>It was very faint, but before it ceased I recognized
the beat of a horse&#8217;s hoofs.</p>

<p>I was in a nervously high strung condition, and as
I knew that there was no house near enough for me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
to be able to hear any one who might be driving or
riding up to it, I tossed my cigar away and drew
back into some bushes to wait for what might be to
come.</p>

<p>It might be just a messenger from Boreski, or even
Boreski himself; or, on the other hand, I persuaded
myself very easily, it might spell danger. In either
case I could do no harm by keeping a watch.</p>

<p>Clearly it was not Boreski, or any one from him,
as in that case he would have ridden right up to the
house. My ears might have deceived me, of course;
but I was conscious of what some people term a creepy
sensation as I accepted the other conclusion&mdash;that the
matter did bode danger of some kind.</p>

<p>I was right too. I stood as still as a statue on my
sentry go, and after some minutes I heard a light
crunch of gravel under stealthily treading feet and
saw a man creeping warily toward the house.</p>

<p>At the same moment I caught a glimpse of Helga.
I could see from my place through the open window
of the room where we had sat. I saw her enter the
room, glance about her in surprise at not finding me
there, and then cross to the window and peer into the
dark garden.</p>

<p>The man at the gate saw her too, and drew back
quickly. A very significant indication.</p>

<p>Helga stood a moment at the window, and then
stepped out on to the verandah that ran along the
house and looked about her as if seeking me. But
I gave no sign of my presence, of course; and after
a while she went back through the window, leaving
it open, crossed the room with a quick step, and passed
out of my line of sight.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the man crept very cautiously and
almost silently a short distance up the gravel walk,
pausing at every step and looking about him as if to
make certain he was unobserved.</p>

<p>When he was quite close to me he stopped, and I
recognized him. It was Paul Drexel. For a moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
a hundred possibilities connected with his visit at such
a time and in such fashion rushed into my mind, and
I was on the point of darting from my hiding-place
and seizing him, when he turned and made a signal.</p>

<p>Following his gaze, I saw that two other men had
entered the grounds and stood mute and motionless
until he waved to them, when they crept up to his side.
Then all three got on to the grass, well in the shadow
of the trees, and held a whispered consultation.</p>

<p>I could not, of course, catch a word they said, but
I saw them point to the open window; and when the
consultation ended two of them stole like shadows
round the skirt of the lawn under cover of the trees
to the window, in front of which both lay flat on the
ground.</p>

<p>Then Drexel crept back a short distance, paused,
turned and walked up the gravel, with intentionally
noisy and heavy steps, to the house door.</p>

<p>It did not require the instincts of a Vidocq to know
that some very ugly business was on foot; and while
Drexel was getting admitted to the house, I was trying
to consider what the thing boded and what I had
best do.</p>

<p>In point of fact I did nothing&mdash;about the wisest
course, as it turned out. To have moved from my
hiding-place would only have scared away the two
men lying prone by the verandah, and so long as I
knew of their presence and they were ignorant of
mine, I had the best end of the stick.</p>

<p>I made a pretty cute guess at the meaning of the
visit. Drexel had no doubt gone to the villa with the
men in the hope of finding me still there, and had
learnt by some means of my coming to Brabinsk.</p>

<p>The stroke was aimed at me I felt, and there was
less alarm for me in that thought than if it had been
directed against Helga. For the time, at any rate,
there would be no danger to her, and as I was thus
forewarned I could take my own measures.</p>

<p>It is a somewhat skeary thing to have to think out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
plans to circumvent men who mean to assassinate you,
and to realize, as I did, very clearly, how much must
hang upon your not making a false step.</p>

<p>As I stood like a statue in the shadows of the trees,
I had time to think things out a bit. I had my revolver
in my pocket, and I came to the conclusion
quite deliberately that if there was any shooting to
be done I would let no one get the drop on me, and
I would certainly shoot to kill. I had twice in my life
had very narrow escapes from death through hesitating
in the face of a crisis, and this was not going to be
a third time. Some minutes&mdash;ten perhaps&mdash;lapsed
after Drexel was admitted to the house before anything
happened, and all the while the men by the
house lay as still as death. Although I knew just
about where they were, I could not see their dark
forms on the ground.</p>

<p>Then Helga entered the room into which I could
see, and Drexel followed her. The instant he was
inside he shut the door and put his back against it.</p>

<p>Helga seemed perfectly calm and self-possessed,
and when he spoke with much gesture, as if excusing
himself, she replied with contemptuous indifference,
mingled with little shafts of indignation.</p>

<p>The conversation lasted some time, until one of the
two men outside lifted his head, so that it came between
me and the light from the window, and listened.
Then he and his companion, still lying prone, drew
themselves cautiously up on to the verandah and lay
close to the open window.</p>

<p>Themselves unseen, they were watching intently
what passed within the room, and listening to every
syllable that was spoken by Helga and Drexel.</p>

<p>So absorbed were the two spies, and so utterly unsuspicious
of my presence, that I might have risked
closing in upon them, had it not been that the broad
drive lay between me and them and the slightest sound
of the gravel under my footsteps would have spoilt
everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>I chafed at the enforced inaction, but the issues
were those of life and death, and I dared not take
such a risk. Helga&#8217;s life, as well as mine, was in the
balance.</p>

<p>At last the minutes of inaction were at an end.</p>

<p>Both men, as if at some signal from Drexel, sprang
to their feet and stepped into the room, and I saw the
flashing look of anger from Helga at their entrance.</p>

<p>The noise they made in entering gave me the chance
I wanted. Two or three light springing tiptoe leaps
put me across the drive, and I hurried over the smooth
lawn with eager feet, drawing out my revolver as I
ran, until, imitating their tactics, I lay full length on
the ground in full sight and within earshot of all that
went on in the room.</p>

<p>I soon had evidence then of the deadly business on
which the men had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you he is not in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Helga&#8217;s voice, of course, and she was facing
the three men with dauntless courage in voice, look,
and manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless to say that, mademoiselle. We know
he is here, and call upon you in the name of the
brotherhood to give him up to us. It is more than
your life is worth to refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was seemingly the leader, and his deep
vibrating bass voice rolled through the room in tones
of intense earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever known me tell you a lie, M.
Vastic?&#8221; This, then, was the reckless Nihilist himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you deny he has been here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American, M. Denver, has been here; but left
this house more than an hour since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To go where?&#8221; The question came like a sharp
stern command.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the man we seek. You know that. Do you
dare to trifle with us?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>&#8220;I allow no one to address me in that tone,&#8221; said
Helga proudly. &#8220;I have told you the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man turned to Drexel, who I saw was very
pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure this man who calls himself Denver
is the Emperor. If you have lied, you will answer
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask mademoiselle,&#8221; said the cowardly cur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, what say you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the man this&mdash;this carrion spy speaks of&#8221;&mdash;and
she turned such a look on Drexel that he
winced&mdash;&#8220;is Mr. Denver, an American. And if
he were the Emperor, M. Vastic, and I knew where
he was at this moment, you are the last man on earth
I would tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no other evidence,&#8221; was the threatening
reply. &#8220;I give you two minutes in which to tell me
where to find him. If you refuse, you will suffer the
consequences. You know the penalty of shielding one
whom the brotherhood has sentenced. Say when the
time is passed,&#8221; he ordered his comrade, and to enforce
his threat he drew a revolver.</p>

<p>Helga gave no sign of flinching, but met his stern
gaze with one to the full, as steady and resolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can murder me if you will. I do not know,&#8221;
she said firmly. Not a change of colour, no quiver
of the lip, nor tremor of a finger showed her courage
to be shaken, or her purpose weakened by the ordeal.</p>

<p>But it was different with me and I made ready to
take up my part in the scene. I calculated precisely
what to do. The second man was near enough to the
window for me to strike him down as I entered, and
I drew myself to my feet in readiness.</p>

<p>But at that moment he moved to speak to Vastic.
He spoke in a whisper and seemed to expostulate.
But the leader remained unmoved by what he said,
and the second man with a shrug of the shoulders
stepped back to his former place.</p>

<p>Helga watched the short whispered conference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
closely, but gave no sign of any feeling, momentous
as the import was to her.</p>

<p>Drexel was, however, growing deeply agitated. His
face was as white as salt, great beads of perspiration
were on his forehead, his lips were quivering, and he
clenched and unclenched his hands with quick nervous
movements.</p>

<p>The turn of affairs had appalled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Vastic,&#8221; he began in low hoarse trembling
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, M. Drexel,&#8221; thundered the leader. &#8220;This
is now my affair. It is your part to obey. Now,
mademoiselle, the time is run out. I give you a last
chance to be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished, for as he spoke
Helga gave a great cry, and I dashed through the
window, dealt the man near me a blow on the head
with my revolver which felled him, and the next moment
I had Vastic covered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hands up, you. I&#8217;ve heard what you said,&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver,&#8221; exclaimed Drexel.</p>

<p>Vastic turned on me instantly, full of fight, and with
the quickness of light raised his revolver to take aim.</p>

<p>It was his life or mine, and without a second&#8217;s hesitation
I fired and shot him.</p>

<p>The fraction of a second decided it. His pistol
went off almost simultaneously. But the bullet went
wide, for mine was in his brain, and he was already
staggering.</p>

<p>There was a scuffle behind me, and another shot was
fired by the man I had knocked down. I turned on
him, but he was too quick for me and with a cry sprang
out into the darkness.</p>

<p>Drexel meanwhile had opened the room door to fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, you, Drexel, or I&#8217;ll fire,&#8221; I cried,
covering him. He came back trembling like the cur
he was. &#8220;Close the window, Helga, and have some
help here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>She was shutting the window when the servants,
with Ivan at their head, came in, having heard the
pistol shots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have that man held, Ivan,&#8221; I said, pointing to
Drexel, who indeed was in a state bordering on collapse,
&#8220;and go instantly in search of a man who has
just fled. Quick, as you care for your mistress&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bent over Vastic and laid my hand on his heart.</p>

<p>When I looked up Helga was standing by me.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; I said in reply to her glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; The cry forced itself between her
pressed lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the body taken somewhere for the present,&#8221;
I ordered one of the servants, &#8220;and then see that every
door and window in the house is safely bolted. I will
speak to you presently,&#8221; I added to Helga, who was
now trembling. &#8220;I must question this man,&#8221; and laying
a heavy hand on Drexel&#8217;s shoulder, I led him into
another room.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XI</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">CONVICTION AT LAST</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">EVENTS had so crowded the few minutes that I
had not had time to think, except in those flashes
of decision necessary in a crisis. My instinct in such
times is to act first and think afterwards. Do something,
whether right or wrong; but do it. And I have
often found that the wrong thing done quickly may
be less dangerous than the right thing done after a too
careful deliberation.</p>

<p>The moment the man Vastic lay dead before my
eyes, I regretted having shot him: a regret due not
only to a naturally intense repugnance to take a fellow-creature&#8217;s
life, but also to reasons of policy. So far as
ethical considerations were concerned, I felt I was justified.
He was going to kill me; and you cannot argue
with a six shooter. It would have been just too soft
to have asked him to put his gun down while we discussed
the question of my identity. The positions
would have been reversed. I should have been dead
when he realized his mistake, instead of his being dead
when I realized mine; and of the two, I preferred
vastly the present sequence.</p>

<p>What I felt I ought to have done was to have
winged and disabled him. He would have been just
as effectually incapable of mischief, and we should all
have been spared the embarrassment of having to deal
with his dead body.</p>

<p>I did not anticipate any serious trouble with the
authorities, for I had no doubt that old Kalkov would
be able to arrange the matter. Vastic was in all probability
known to the police; he had been killed in an
attempt upon the life of the man he believed to be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Emperor; and his death was not unlikely to be welcome
enough to the Government.</p>

<p>But there were his comrades to consider; and that
they would set about avenging him there was no room
to doubt. There had been an eye-witness who, unless
Ivan caught him, would carry the news straight to
them; and their anger was as certain to fall upon
Helga as to be directed against me.</p>

<p>This prompted a number of disquieting and perplexing
considerations.</p>

<p>My first thought was for Helga&#8217;s safety; and obviously
the only thing to do was to get her away to
some hiding-place where these men would be unable
to find her. To induce her to leave would, however,
be so difficult, that I could think of but one means of
influencing her&mdash;and that was to encourage her mistaken
belief that I was the Emperor. It meant deceit
on my part; but in such a case the end must justify
the means. She must be saved; and if no other way
was open, I must be content with that.</p>

<p>There was another consideration, moreover. My
own safety depended to a great extent upon these
members of the Nihilist brotherhood continuing to
regard me as the Emperor. It was true I should
probably be the object of attack so long as they believed
I was virtually at their mercy at Brabinsk, and
divorced from the usual safeguards and precautions
which fenced off the Emperor in the Palace. But that
danger was temporary, and would cease the moment
I got back to the Palace, and resumed my own
character.</p>

<p>With the temporary danger I could trust myself to
deal, now that I was forewarned. But if they once
got an inkling of the truth, I should be the object of
their vengeance every minute I remained in Russia,
and very possibly afterwards. And I had the greatest
possible repugnance against playing the part of quarry
for Nihilist bloodhounds to hunt all over Europe.</p>

<p>These considerations and many others wove themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
rapidly into the web of my anxious perplexity
as I paced up and down the room, followed by the
staring, fright-filled eyes of the despicable Drexel,
whose cowardly treachery had caused all the trouble.
He was so frightened indeed, that every time I chanced
to look at him he would shrink and cower and hang
his head in fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well be frightened,&#8221; I said at length,
turning on him; &#8220;for I&#8217;m thinking whether the safest
thing to do is not to put a bullet in your head. Dead
men carry no tales.&#8221; I spoke with intentional brutality.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of God don&#8217;t do that, your Majesty.
It&#8217;s not my fault; indeed, indeed it isn&#8217;t. Oh, God
have mercy on me;&#8221; and he shuddered in a veritable
paroxysm of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you armed? Turn your pockets out. Quick!&#8221;
I cried.</p>

<p>The haste with which he complied was almost ludicrous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only carried this for self-protection, your Majesty.
You know I have made no attempt to use it,&#8221; he said,
as he brought a revolver out of an inner pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even to try and protect the woman you were
to have married. I know that because I was watching
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your Majesty knows I had no chance. I
should only have been killed on the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and if you had been? Is that a worse death
than at the hands of the executioner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh God, oh God, have mercy on me,&#8221; he moaned,
covering his craven face with trembling fingers. It
has always disgusted me to see how readily this type
of mangy cur turns his thoughts to the Deity when
some specially infamous act has been followed by
discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think your God likes your kind of work?
Get together what little of a man there is in you, and
face the thing. Don&#8217;t slobber and whine like that. You
make me sick with disgust.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>He seemed to make such effort as was possible, and
after a few moments ventured to look at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your Majesty graciously hear me? I am
really innocent. I am indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prove it. Tell me all you&#8217;ve done since last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can give your Majesty valuable information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Informer now as well as spy, eh? Answer my
question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether he thought he could read some hope in
these words I don&#8217;t know, but he began to show less
abject terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the secrets of all the people here&mdash;M.
Boreski and Mademoiselle Helga. Will your Majesty
spare my life if I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I would make a compact with a
thing like you?&#8221; I cried in disgust. &#8220;You can tell
me nothing I do not already know, except how you
brought Vastic and the other on my track. Tell me
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski is a Polish conspirator, and mademoiselle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; I interposed sternly. &#8220;Speak of yourself
and your part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is information your Majesty should have,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn you, keep to your own part,&#8221; I cried furiously,
&#8220;or to the police you go under guard at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrank back from my fierce words, and his flabby
face turned grey with renewed terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;As your Majesty wishes,&#8221; he said, when he had
recovered sufficiently to speak. &#8220;They have cheated
me and lied to me; they made me promises to buy my
silence, and last night quarrelled with me and set me
at defiance. They told me I was free to go and do as
I liked. No man can bear to be cheated. I was mad
in my anger, and I went to Vastic and told him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Told him what?&#8221; I demanded, when he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sorry the moment I had spoken, and repented
my anger.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>&#8220;To the devil with your feelings. What did you do
and say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that Boreski was false to his oath to the
brotherhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cunning with which he thus got out his charge
against Boreski of being a sworn Nihilist and at the
same time coloured the description of his own act, did
not escape me.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; I asked; and he fumbled with the question
in dire doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;By failing to report a matter of grave importance
to the brotherhood, your Majesty,&#8221; he answered at
length.</p>

<p>&#8220;What matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Particulars of your Majesty&#8217;s movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, you told them I was at mademoiselle&#8217;s
villa, and that M. Boreski knew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that you <i>were</i>, your Majesty&mdash;I am no traitor&mdash;but
that you <i>had been</i>.&#8221; He made the distinction
eagerly. &#8220;I intended to punish Boreski for his insult
to me, not, as God is my judge, to bring any danger
upon your Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a bad liar. You brought the men here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no! your Majesty. On my soul, not in
search of you. Besides, I was in imminent fear of my
life. I saw then the mistake I had made in ever saying
a word. They made me accompany them to the villa,
and when we heard Boreski was not there, nor Mademoiselle
Helga, they forced me at the pistol point to
seek them here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew I had come here?&#8221; and I searched his
face with angry eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I did not know. How could I know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> know it,&#8221; I said, putting up a bluff. It told.
The despair in his eyes showed me this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vastic would have killed me,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you preferred he should kill me. I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t say that; don&#8217;t think it, your Majesty.
I am innocent. Indeed, indeed, I am. Oh, my God,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
that this should be thought of me;&#8221; and he set up his
whining again.</p>

<p>&#8220;One more question, and I&#8217;ve done with you. How
many men came with this Vastic?&#8221;</p>

<p>He showed such unnecessary agitation at the question
that I saw he had still some hidden motive or
hope, and I had threatened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only one, your Majesty; only the man you saw,
as I am a living man.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was lying, of course; and equally, of course, I
must have out of him the truth on a point of such vital
import to us all at Brabinsk. I thought round his possible
motive, and then hit on it.</p>

<p>He was trusting that Vastic&#8217;s associates would return
to accomplish the task in which he had failed,
and in that case they would of course rescue the spy
who had served them so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite sure that there was only one?&#8221; I
asked, in an ordinary tone, as if merely needing a
repetition of his statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not be mistaken. I swear it. I would
not lie to your Majesty in such a matter,&#8221; he asserted
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I said, and rang the bell. &#8220;I have yet
to decide what to do with you for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the servant came, I told him to wait and
guard Drexel until my return; and going out, I asked
for Ivan, and inquired whether he had caught the man
he had gone after. Unfortunately he had not. Not a
trace of him had he seen, but he had heard the sound
of wheels, and concluded that the man had dashed for
the vehicle in which the three had come, and had galloped
off.</p>

<p>This seemed to lend colour to Drexel&#8217;s statement;
but I had been so sure of his lying that I went back,
resolved to put him to a pretty severe ordeal.</p>

<p>I sent the servant out of the room, and then looked
sternly at the prisoner, who was staring eagerly at me
as if to read his fate in my face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>&#8220;I have made up my mind in regard to you. If
you had told me the truth in answer to my last question,
I might have spared you. But you lied&mdash;and
that lie will cost you your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew my revolver again, and made pretence to
examine the cartridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;You led these men here in search of me. I know
that. I saw you when you first entered the grounds
here, and watched you. For aiding an attempt on my
life the penalty is death, and rightly so. I intend to
inflict the penalty myself. Stand up;&#8221; and I levelled
the pistol at his face.</p>

<p>Stand up he could not; he lacked the actual physical
strength. He sat grasping the arms of the chair,
staring at me, his eyes wide open and mouth agape,
his lips quivering and his colour dull grey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot die; I cannot die. For the love of Almighty
God, spare my life, your Majesty. Oh God,
oh God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up,&#8221; I thundered; and he winced and shrank
and quivered at my voice. An abject, terror-struck
craven, he was at once pitiable and hateful even to look
at. His very voice refused to obey him as he gasped
and gurgled in his effort to speak; but at length he
stammered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lied to you; but spare my life, and I will
tell the truth now. I will, I will, as God is my judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick then, for my finger itches with impatience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We three came alone, as I said, your Majesty; but
a number of the others were to follow us as soon as
possible, in case of the scheme failing and help being
needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. Eight or ten, or twelve perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laid the pistol down.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have saved your life for the while,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;As for the rest, it will depend upon what occurs
here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>The rush of relief at my words was too great for
his overstrung nerves, and he fainted. I called the
servants and ordered them to restore him, and then
bind him and put him in a place of safety.</p>

<p>This done, I hurried in search of Helga, to consult
with her upon the new developments.</p>

<p>I found that she had had Vastic&#8217;s body removed to
one of the cellars of the house, and she had entirely
recovered her self-composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your nerve is splendid,&#8221; I said admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a life as mine trains one to face emergencies.
What does your Majesty wish to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a good deal to settle,&#8221; I answered, accepting
without protest her method of address. She
intended me to understand that her conviction was
firmer than ever; and as I believed I could influence
her with much less difficulty if she held to it, I appeared
to acquiesce.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have formed some plan, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. In my view, the sooner we are all away from
this place, the better;&#8221; and I told her briefly what I
had forced from Drexel.</p>

<p>&#8220;They could do no harm to us here, even if there
were a dozen of them,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but we should have much more chance of
escaping their notice if we were to travel to the city
by night rather than by day.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was perplexed by this, and questioned me with
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You yourself are now in imminent personal danger,
and must lose no time in getting to a place of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Palace,&#8221; I answered, speaking on the spur
of necessity to give some definite answer; and in truth
that seemed the best thing to do.</p>

<p>She started and caught her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She was all anxious eagerness
now.</p>

<p>I paused a second, and then took the plunge and
answered with deliberate significance&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>&#8220;After what has passed here, your safety is now
my concern and your desires are mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She read my words in the way I intended. She
turned slightly pale, and in her agitation caught at
the back of the chair by which she stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; I heard her whisper under her breath.</p>

<p>I felt pretty mean at the trick I was playing, when
I saw how she took it; but I had persuaded myself
there was no other way, and held firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not trusted you in vain,&#8221; she said, after the
pause. &#8220;Your Majesty has but to speak your wishes;
it is for me to obey;&#8221; and she gave me one of her
sweet, frank smiles.</p>

<p>I felt meaner than ever; but I was in up to the
neck, and deliberately plunged deeper. Under an impulse
I could not control, for her smile and words of
trust carried me away, I took her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the Emperor you trust, Helga, or the man?&#8221;
I asked, in a voice low with passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you, monsieur;&#8221; and again she lifted her
glorious eyes to my face, and then withdrew them on
meeting my look.</p>

<p>&#8220;May God deal with me as I merit, if I desert
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stood thus for a moment, when, at the sound
of some one approaching the room, she drew away
from me, with a glance and a sigh.</p>

<p>It was Ivan with news.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have heard the sound of some one driving
furiously toward the house, my lord. What shall
we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; I answered, and he hurried away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will run no risks, monsieur?&#8221; cried Helga
swiftly and anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have too much at stake&mdash;now,&#8221; I answered, out
of the earnestness of my heart. &#8220;God send we may
all get out of this safely. I will arrange with Ivan for
our leaving. Will you get ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do everything you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>The words were in my ears as I hurried out and
up the staircase to the room where Ivan was keeping
watch. I had my plan. I would take Helga with
me back to the Palace at all risks, get an audience
with the Emperor, and lay the whole affair, her story
and all, before him, and ask his protection. In truth,
I was mad enough just then to venture anything.</p>

<p>These things rushed through my head as I ran up
to Ivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is well, my lord,&#8221; he said, coming to meet
me. &#8220;It is M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Now we shall know more
of the truth.&#8221; A remark far more disastrously true
than I could have anticipated.</p>

<p>When I went downstairs again, Boreski had already
been admitted, and was with Helga. All impatience
for his news I entered the room; and opening the
door, started.</p>

<p>A third person was there: a tall woman in black,
heavily veiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, M. Boreski; you are welcome.
What news do you bring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, monsieur,&#8221; he replied, and I
noticed restraint in his tone and manner.</p>

<p>Helga too was looking at me curiously. I smiled
to her, but, instead of replying, she looked to the
woman in black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked. I began to scent mischief.</p>

<p>The woman threw up her veil, and I saw she was
well on in years, pale and plain, but had an air of
distinction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know me, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, madame. To the best of my knowledge,
I have never had the pleasure of seeing you in my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and Boreski threw up
his hands.</p>

<p>A pale shadow crept over Helga&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>&#8220;I am positive, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so am I,&#8221; said the new-comer, with a touch
of scorn. &#8220;That is no more the Emperor than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw things then. There was a moment&#8217;s critical
silence. Then Helga broke it, speaking in a chill,
cutting tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the Duchess Stephanie&mdash;M. Boreski&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; I answered; and for the life of me,
acute as the situation had suddenly become, I could
not for the time get out another word to redeem it.</p>

<p>The cold, hard look in Helga&#8217;s eyes as she faced
me was for the time unendurable, and I turned my
head away in sheer tongue-tied embarrassment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">HELGA&#8217;S ANGER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was certainly one of the most untimely kicks
which Fate could have dealt me; and it took
all my reserved strength to brace myself and shake
off my first feeling of dismay in order to put any
sort of face on the thing. But I have a good deal
of india-rubber in me.</p>

<p>So I pulled myself together, and surprised them
all by turning on Boreski and saying, in a very sharp
tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you get here a quarter of an hour
sooner, and have saved half this embarrassment?&#8221;
It is generally a safe tactic when something goes
wrong to attack the other fellow. Boreski started,
and I followed up the attack. &#8220;If you loiter and
fool away the time at such a crisis, what is it but
just opening the door and inviting trouble to walk in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not wasted a single minute, monsieur,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;Besides, I cannot see what that has to
do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle can tell you,&#8221; and I looked at Helga.
I think she saw the drift, but she said nothing. Poor
girl, she was too overwhelmed by the fiasco of her
plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is not whether I came soon or late,
monsieur,&#8221; said Boreski with slow precision, &#8220;but who
and what you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I mean. The very pith of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That does not trouble me very much; but mademoiselle
does.&#8221; I was resolved to force her to speak.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Besides, my temper was beginning to be tried by
Boreski&#8217;s manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a matter for us as men to settle without
bringing Mademoiselle Helga, or any other woman,
into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish and nonsense,&#8221; I said irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; he exclaimed angrily, &#8220;I do not permit
any one to address such words to me. You will
not explain your imposture by insulting me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your temper with me, if you please, monsieur,
or you will only render a bad situation worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is monstrous,&#8221; said the Duchess Stephanie.
&#8220;He is Prince Kalkov&#8217;s spy, of course, and seeks
to cover the infamy of his imposture with this amazing
insolence.&#8221;</p>

<p>This gave me an excellent cue, for I saw Helga
wince; and I hoped she resented alike the charge,
and the way it was made. What the other two
thought of me I cared not a five-cent piece: and
with Helga herself I had only to explain away my
last act of implied confirmation of her mistake as
to my identity. It would not be easy, of course,
because the disappointment to her must inevitably
cause her to exaggerate its meanness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am neither a criminal nor a spy, madame,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have an explanation,&#8221; cried Boreski insistently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no explanation to give, except that if
you had arrived a quarter of an hour earlier all
this&mdash;this excitement would have been unnecessary.
For what occurred in that quarter of an hour I am
profoundly sorry;&#8221; and I looked again at Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Stephanie; this is a monstrous
thing,&#8221; cried Boreski. He rose and came toward
me, and said, with a sort of fierce contemptuousness:
&#8220;You do not explain because you have no explanation.
You are a spy; some new and zealous member of the
secret police, no doubt. You will be kept here until
I find means to make you speak.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>&#8220;Good,&#8221; exclaimed the Duchess, &#8220;very good. The
only way, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>I contented myself with a shrug of the shoulders,
and met his angry look with one of complete
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen that kind of mood before with other
impostors and spies of the same type.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your opinion of me, M. Boreski, is a matter of
absolute indifference.&#8221; I said this calmly and deliberately,
and added: &#8220;And I repeat, you are only
making a bad situation much worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such effrontery!&#8221; exclaimed the Duchess, with
another of her angry comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you a last chance to tell the whole truth
about yourself, before I send for the men and hand
you over to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very good of you, monsieur,&#8221; I answered
flippantly; and then turning to Helga: &#8220;It occurs
to me, mademoiselle, that while we are quarrelling
here, we are wasting invaluable time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak?&#8221; she replied, breaking her
long silence.</p>

<p>The Duchess Stephanie, not understanding what
lay beneath the words, shrugged her shoulders and
gave an audible sniff of contempt.</p>

<p>Boreski, on the other hand, crossed to the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have no more of this. I will have the
men in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay.&#8221; This from Helga, in an unmistakable tone
of command.</p>

<p>The other two stared at her for an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot detain M. Denver. You are at liberty
to leave the house, monsieur,&#8221; she said, turning
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is just what I will not do&mdash;at any
rate, yet. When I know you are safe, I will do
whatever you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not need your further assistance, monsieur.&#8221;
This very proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that you are just a little unjust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have deceived me grossly, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only because you would not let me undeceive you;
and I saw, or thought, the only way left was to let
you believe what I saw you persisted in believing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw it, then, and acted intentionally?&#8221; she
said, very bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I don&#8217;t deny that with regard to what passed
between us last. But I thought&mdash;I hoped you <i>felt</i>
you could trust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes and avoided the earnest look
I directed on her; and there was a pause of some
length. Then, without looking at me, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only say now, you are free to go, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While you are threatened by the dangers I have
all unintentionally brought upon you, I will not go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible for you to remain, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said my last word on that point, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreski had fidgetted uneasily as we spoke, and
now intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard, monsieur, what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, if you please, M. Boreski,&#8221; I cried with
heat. &#8220;You do not understand. If I cannot comply
with mademoiselle&#8217;s wishes, do you think I shall heed
what you say? It is you, with your hot-headed quarrel
with Drexel last night, who have brought about
all this mess. And Heaven knows it is bad enough
to satisfy any ordinary blunderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreski fell back before my hot words and looks,
but his wife was quick to take offence. She got up
pale and angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either that spy is driven from the house, Helga,
or I do not stay in it. I will not hear my husband
insulted.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was like a woman of her type, of course, to put
her oar in with such a silly splash and make things
much worse. But it had the effect I wished. It
forced Helga to defend me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>&#8220;You do not understand, Duchess. M. Denver is
no spy. He came to us yesterday under equivocal
circumstances, but this morning took the first moment
to tell me he was not the&mdash;was no other than M.
Denver, an American; and I in my blindness could
not and did not believe it. It is I who am responsible.
It is all a terrible tangle, but I will answer for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for that, mademoiselle. I was sure
you would do me justice.&#8221; I was so happy at her
words that I could easily afford to ignore the sneer
with which the Duchess resumed her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all very extraordinary,&#8221; she said hastily.
&#8220;But you are right in one thing, Helga, I do not
in the least understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga did not appear at all anxious to explain, so
I took the opportunity to make my own position
clearer, not for the Duchess&#8217;s benefit, but for Helga&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as simple as disastrous, madame,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;M. Boreski, having quarrelled last night with this
Drexel, the latter went to M. Vastic, one of the leaders
of the Nihilist Brotherhood, and told him he would
find the Emperor at mademoiselle&#8217;s villa. He went
there, and finding we had come on here, he and others
followed us, and he attempted my life. I shot him,
and I have since dragged from Drexel the admission
that many of his associates are coming here, and it
is extremely probable they will make some attack
upon us to avenge him. Their vengeance would of
course include both M. Boreski and Mademoiselle
Helga, as well as myself. That is why I cannot leave
until she is safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drexel is here, then?&#8221; said Boreski quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish him to confirm what I have said,
monsieur, you can question him. But I think we
ought to be seeing to things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is horrible,&#8221; exclaimed the Duchess, intensely
frightened. &#8220;If I am discovered here everything will
be ruined. Loris, you must take me back to the city
at once.&#8221; One excuses a woman for thinking first of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
herself, of course, and I quite appreciated the awkwardness
of her position. But Helga was not so
tolerant. She looked at the Duchess coldly and a
little scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski had better take you away at once,
Duchess,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better go,&#8221; said Boreski. &#8220;What must
be done is to explain to Vastic&#8217;s friends the manner
in which we have all been duped.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my cue, of course, and I saw my way
instantly. But it struck Helga from quite a different
point of view.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be only to turn this into a private
feud against M. Denver for the death of Vastic.
That is as impossible as it would be dishonourable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot this gentleman defend himself? He came
of his own will surely, and should not shirk the consequences,&#8221;
said the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Boreski is right,&#8221; I put in, &#8220;and I think I
see a way.&#8221; I got up as I spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, monsieur?&#8221; asked
Helga quickly, in some concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to obey your wishes, mademoiselle,
and leave the house,&#8221; I answered with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not let him go. If these men come here
it will be in search of him; and if you give him up
to them, it will show them they have nothing against
Loris and you, Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Helga was thinking closely, and seemed not to
hear this admirable advice. Boreski looked from one
to the other in doubt what to do. For a few moments
there was silence.</p>

<p>Then an ominous interruption came from outside.
A sound of a pistol shot, followed by running footsteps
along the verandah, and the violent slamming of
a door somewhere.</p>

<p>The Duchess jumped to her feet in fear and great
agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can that be?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8220;I fear it means you must delay your flight,
Duchess,&#8221; said Helga with scarcely veiled disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I your permission to go and see what
has occurred, mademoiselle?&#8221; I asked; and without
waiting for it, I turned to the door.</p>

<p>As I opened it, Ivan reached it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I speak to you a moment, my lord?&#8221; he
asked, looking very set and determined, and breathing
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come with you,&#8221; said Helga. We went
out and left Boreski and his excited, panic-stricken
wife alone. &#8220;What has happened, Ivan?&#8221; asked
Helga. &#8220;That shot; is any one hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mademoiselle. I was outside looking round,
thinking it best to keep a watch, and two men who
had concealed themselves in the shrubbery rushed
upon me. I fired the shot more to give the alarm than
thinking to harm them, and then ran back indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think it means, Ivan?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is only one explanation, my lord.
There must have been some of M. Vastic&#8217;s friends
in the district, and they have come because of his
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say for certain, my lord. I saw several
as I ran to the house door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done very well to find this out and
give us warning. But we must devise means to avoid
a conflict of any kind. They may be merely watching
the house; I should think that&#8217;s most probable,
indeed. They would scarcely attempt to force an
entrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They attacked me, your honour,&#8221; said Ivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely to get from you who was inside, I expect.
So keep as vigilant a watch as you can, while I think
what to do. Of course they must be kept out&mdash;at
any rate, for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had my purpose fixed already, and when Ivan
had gone I turned to Helga, and found her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
fixed upon my face steadily. I did not wish her to
read my thoughts, and forced up a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Ivan has unnecessarily alarmed us, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am trying to guess what is in your thoughts,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very happy to tell you. I think these
men have come to watch the house, as their habit is,&#8221;
I replied briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an actor you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who has knocked about the world as I
have picks up the knack, more or less, I suppose. I
seem to have played the part with you a bit too well,
I am afraid. I should like you to know that I&#8217;m horribly
sorry and horribly ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night when you spoke of my leaving here with
you, you allowed me to deceive myself. You allowed
it intentionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I did more. I encouraged the deception.
I suppose you can&#8217;t think a man would do a mean
thing for any but a mean motive, yet I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I
broke off, and threw up my hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use
trying to explain all I felt. I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; We were
standing in the large square hall, and I walked to one
end and stood by the great stove. &#8220;When I look at
you and think of it, I feel like what they said of me
in there&mdash;a spy. I was one when I came to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke of taking me to the Palace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to do it, too. I would have got you to
the Emperor. I should have had some claim on him
for this business, and I&#8217;d have got you a hearing.
But I suppose it looks to you like treachery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you made me think that, as the Emperor,
you were taking me there to do me justice. I should
never trust you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rub it in. I feel quite mean enough already.
You might be sorry, too. I&#8217;m not going to ask you
to trust me again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you could listen as you did to all my story!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
To think I should have put myself in the power of
such a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>I winced under this punishment as a dog under the
lash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I should betray you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell, after what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. There is that, of course.&#8221; I paused with
a frown of pain. &#8220;Is it any good for me to say I
should not? I wish you could say you don&#8217;t think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your wishes to me?&#8221; she cried, flashing
her eyes at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, of course; or less than nothing&mdash;just
spurs to your contempt, it seems. Well, I don&#8217;t suppose
there&#8217;s anything else to be said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have made you feel how dishonourably you
have acted, and how cruelly your conduct has crushed
and ruined everything I hold dear, it may perhaps
make you pause when you find your next victim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likely to forget even without these lashes
of yours to remind me.&#8221; I could endure no more of
this merciless injustice. &#8220;I will go and see what Ivan
is doing,&#8221; I added, recrossing the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, if you please. I have faithful servants who
will protect me if I am in any danger. I will not be
beholden for my safety to you, M. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned and looked at her scornful, angry face. I
had rather she had struck me.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;Even that;&#8221; and I sat on
a lounge and put my hand to my head. There was a
rustle of skirts, and when I looked up she had gone,
and left me to my belated remorse and my new
purpose.</p>

<p>I would have given anything for a single word of
forgiveness, or even for a glance of some feeling less
bitter than her contempt and anger. Well, it would
have to come afterwards, when I had saved her, despite
her repudiation of my help; and I rose to carry
out my plan.</p>

<p>I went to Ivan and asked him what he had seen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
He told me a number of men were round the house.
He noticed that I was pale&mdash;for the interview with
Helga had shaken me badly&mdash;and asked if I was ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not ill, Ivan, but strange things have
happened. Listen to me and help me. I am not what
you have thought, but what I told you during the ride&mdash;M.
Denver, an American. All unwillingly I have
brought your mistress into great danger, and I am
going to get her out of it. I am going to those men
outside to convince them I am only what I have told
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt me and don&#8217;t look like a madman.
This must be done, otherwise they will never believe
that mademoiselle has not been guilty of treachery to
them, and her life will always be in danger at their
hands. Now, don&#8217;t be a fool and make a fuss. I
caused the trouble, and I must find the way out of it.
And the only way is this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Lord of the Earth, they will kill you before
you can get time for a word. It is madness, monsieur,
stark, staring madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste time in this way. I know the risk
you speak of as well as you, and I am content to
face it. If that happens, what you have to do is to
make them know the truth after they&#8217;ve done it. It
will be easier then; but, easy or difficult, you must
make them understand it somehow; for only so can
we save your mistress&#8217;s life. She told Vastic in the
other man&#8217;s hearing that I was not the Emperor; remember
that, and rub it into them well; and make
them understand that Vastic&#8217;s death was my act and
mine only. Of course, if they don&#8217;t pot me off-hand,
I may be able to open their eyes myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell the mademoiselle, monsieur,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort. If you do, I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll
thrash you. Just lead me to a door I can get out
by quietly, and leave the rest to me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>He looked at me so long and earnestly that I
thought he was going to protest again. But he did
not. Instead, he seized my hand and pressed it to
his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go with you, monsieur,&#8221; he cried, almost
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; I said roughly, although his
devotion touched me very nearly. &#8220;Show me the
way out. You&#8217;d be no use to me out there, and your
mistress can&#8217;t spare us both at such a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come then, monsieur,&#8221; and he led the way down
a long corridor. &#8220;Wait, monsieur, while I see if they
are near the door,&#8221; he muttered, and then left me.
He was gone so long that I grew irritable, and when
he came back I spoke very sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will be the best way, monsieur,&#8221; and taking
me to the front door of the house, he left me again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, and be ready to shut and bolt it after
me, Ivan,&#8221; I said angrily, as I drew back two of the
heavy bolts.</p>

<p>As I did so, I felt a light touch on my arm, and
turned quickly to find Helga, white and agitated, by
my side.</p>

<p>Then I knew why Ivan had run away. If he had
not, I would have made my threat good.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE ATTACK</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WHAT are you doing, M. Denver?&#8221; asked
Helga.</p>

<p>Her inopportune arrival took me so completely by
surprise that for the moment I could think of no
plausible answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I was seeing to the security of the door,&#8221; I
said very lamely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Making it secure by drawing back the bolts, do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice had still the hard steely tone that had so
hurt me before, and her glance was coldly penetrating.</p>

<p>&#8220;One must first draw back a bolt before shooting
it again to see that it is in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had already drawn back two and were on
the third when I stopped you. You were going to
open the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know so well what I was doing that I suppose
you know also I was going to open the door to
let the men in. I am a spy and was acting like you
no doubt think a spy would. Why should I try to
hide things any longer? You know me so well.&#8221; I
spoke as if now reckless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan has told me everything you said to him,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Ivan&#8217;s a fool and ought to have his head
punched. You told me before that means must be
found to stop his chattering tongue. Of course he
only knows what I chose to tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were going out to these men in a forlorn
hope of making them see you are not the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed and shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I told him. But you know me better
than to think me such a fool. You know I was going
out as one spy to other spies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were really going out to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My capacity to harm you in here being checkmated,
it was natural enough I should look for some
other means. Surely you can see this.&#8221; And after a
short pause I added with another laugh, &#8220;You have
made me your enemy, you see, and must take the
consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment or two she said nothing, keeping her
eyes fixed intently on my face, with an expression that
baffled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;How were you going to do what you said to
Ivan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just a ridiculous question? I had to
make up some sort of yarn for him. But you know
how good I am at acting. I said what came first, of
course; but I tell you I was going out to give these
men the chance of getting at you easily&mdash;to set them
on you, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes clouded and she frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you never tell me the truth, never be candid
with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you are unreasonable. How could I make
a more perfectly candid declaration of war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to think you utterly vile, that
you paint yourself in these colours?&#8221; The cold steel
tone gave place to a note of passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you think of me. You told me to-night;
and I don&#8217;t see that anything could make it
much worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you have forgotten.&#8221; Her voice was cold
steel again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. Of course a spy must have unpleasant
things said to him, and have to learn to forget quickly.
It&#8217;s a happy gift at times I assure you.&#8221; I spoke as
indifferently as I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not a true note in your voice. You do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
remember that I said I would not owe my safety to
you. I repeat it, I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that any reason you should object to my going
out to betray you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to insult as well as humiliate me,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pendulum of her mood was swinging over to
passion again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you spared me?&#8221; I asked sharply. &#8220;When
the lash of your contemptuous words is burning and
scorching like fire strokes now? Had you not deemed
me utterly base and mean, would you have said what
you did? If you thought it then, you must think it
now; and you may as well think I am foul and
cowardly enough to go out and betray you? It would
be no great effort of imagination for you. I beg your
pardon,&#8221; I said, thrusting my momentary anger away.
&#8220;I did not mean to lose my temper. I have been
sorely tried, but I will not do that. No, I do not
wish to humiliate or insult you. I thought perhaps
I could help you a bit out of this mess I have got you
into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should regard your help as a humiliation, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowing that, I did not mean you to hear of it.
That&#8217;s Ivan&#8217;s fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not go out to them, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed, and she stamped her foot angrily at the
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know your life would not be worth a moment&#8217;s
purchase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done me the honour to show how worthless
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You twist everything I say to you,&#8221; she cried impatiently.
&#8220;You will give me your word of honour
that you will not go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very inconsistent. At one moment you
all but order me out of your house; at the next you
prevent my going. It is absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>&#8220;When I told you you could leave, we did not
know of the danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is my life to you?&#8221; I took a leaf out of
her book and asked the question in a tone as cold and
hard as she had used, while I looked at her very
steadily. She met my look but did not answer my
question. &#8220;You think me a spy, what then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think you a spy, monsieur. You know
that. You heard me tell M. Boreski that I would
answer for you. You can be bitterly unjust.&#8221;</p>

<p>So there was some feeling after all under her cold
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not speak of injustice, mademoiselle,&#8221; I
said, in the same tone. &#8220;But I had forgotten Boreski.
I owe this to him even more than to you perhaps; so
that I cannot pass my word not to go out. He would
not object&mdash;nor his Duchess either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will drive me mad, monsieur,&#8221; she cried
impetuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I use the tone you have taught me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say you shall not do this insane thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her passion mounted fast enough now, and I was
not unwilling to feed the fire. Anything rather than
her contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Then shall we go in and play a hand
at cards while these gentlemen outside complete their
plans? Allow me,&#8221; and I made a mocking pretence
to offer my arm.</p>

<p>She drew back and trembled with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>I flung up my hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are difficult to please, mademoiselle,&#8221; I said,
smiling airily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give me your word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you suggest any other way out of the thing?
That is much more to the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not risk your life in this mad way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; I held up my hand. My ear had caught
the sound of grating steps on the stone outside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
door. We stood and listened, and the sound came
again, followed by a gentle knock at the door.</p>

<p>I led her a few paces away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to answer that knock myself. Trust
me. I will not betray you. Go into the room to
Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a thousand worlds,&#8221; she answered vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let this misunderstanding cease. I will run no
unnecessary risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are moments when many things are made
plain; and that was one of them for Helga and me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot trust you&mdash;to run no risks, I mean. I
cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other things?&#8221; She was silent. &#8220;Helga?&#8221;</p>

<p>She started as I used her name, and drew a deep
breath which escaped in a tremulous sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>My heart gave a great leap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>The knock at the door was repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I ask and leave me to deal with this. I
shall run no risks&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ivan had heard the second knock and now came to
us asking for instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you ascertain how many there are at the door
here, Ivan? Try and make out from some upper
window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not venture out?&#8221; said Helga as soon
as he had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is altered now. I go back to my
former plan. We can stay here until it is safe to
leave&mdash;since we know these men are dogging us,
daylight will probably be the safest; and we will get
to the Emperor when you are safely concealed in the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had too much to live for now to care about putting
my life to the hazard in the way I had purposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
in my mood of desperation. It was once more my
desire now to make the men believe that I was indeed
the Emperor, so that the pursuit of me should cease
the instant I could get back to the Palace.</p>

<p>But my plans were still fated to be thwarted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only make out two men, monsieur; but
there may be many others hidden close by,&#8221; said Ivan,
returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can at any rate speak to them. Call a couple
of the men to be ready at hand in case of need,&#8221; I
told him; and in that way like a fool played into
their hands.</p>

<p>Ivan at my bidding went to the door and called
through it&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are police. Open.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was either a very ugly new development or
a lie. I chose to regard it as the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; was Ivan&#8217;s next question.</p>

<p>&#8220;We seek M. Vastic. Open at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nobody here of that name. We open
the door to no one at this time of night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall break it in,&#8221; said the voice. &#8220;Open, in
the name of the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them to break it in if they can,&#8221; said I, and
Ivan gave the reply; whereupon they commenced to
hammer and bang at the door with such a clatter that
the mere noise itself ought to have roused my suspicions.
But my wits were as dull as a dunce&#8217;s to their
ruse; and I had not a thought of their trick until a
loud noise with a great smashing of glass at the back
of the house told us their object had been merely to
distract our attention downstairs while the real attack
was delivered on an upper floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to Boreski, mademoiselle,&#8221; I cried as I dashed
up the broad stairway, followed by Ivan and the men.
The others had rushed up by a back staircase and met
us on the landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have they got in?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>&#8220;That room,&#8221; said one of them, pointing to a door.
A glance at it showed me the key was outside, and in
a moment I had turned it upon those within. Not a
second too soon. As the lock shot home the handle
was rattled by some one inside.</p>

<p>Ivan had seen me and immediately rushed through
into an adjoining room where I heard him lock and
bolt the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The room leads into this dressing-room, monsieur,&#8221;
he said as he came out. &#8220;But the door is
only a slight one and will not keep them back.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went in and examined it, and, coming to the same
conclusion, promptly abandoned it as a point of defence.
I then sent Ivan to fetch Boreski, and while
he was away thought out an impromptu scheme for
defending the landing place.</p>

<p>It lent itself well enough to such a purpose. It
formed a square, on one side of which were the
stairs; and it was thus possible to place men so that
they could command the doors by which the men
must come out; and my simple plan was to form a
sort of barricade with some heavy pieces of furniture
from behind which we could operate.</p>

<p>With Boreski came Helga full of pluck, resource
and ideas. I explained my plan to them and sent
two men downstairs to keep watch against a further
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can keep the watch, the Duchess and I,&#8221; said
Helga instantly; &#8220;and thus leave you much stronger.&#8221;
But the Duchess as promptly declared she had no
nerve for work of the kind and further tried to induce
Boreski to stay with her.</p>

<p>He was no coward, however, and when Helga
vetoed the suggestion with great indignation and I
joined with her, he sided with us and she had to give
way, doing so with great reluctance.</p>

<p>Helga then went downstairs and our preparations
were soon complete.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men in the room were suspiciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
quiet. Probably they realized, as we did, that they
had gained very little by getting into the house by
the way they had chosen and were really caught in
a kind of trap, from which further progress into the
house would be attended with more danger than they
cared to face.</p>

<p>A glance at my watch showed me, to my surprise,
it was nearly eleven o&#8217;clock. The hours had flown
very quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At what hour is it daylight?&#8221; I asked Boreski.</p>

<p>&#8220;About half-past three,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we shall have four or five hours of this.
They&#8217;ll clear off when the light comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better speak to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means if you can do any good. You know
them, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He climbed over the barricade and rapped at the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I am Boreski.&#8221; No
reply was made, and he knocked and called again.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any one is in there,&#8221; he said to me in
a whisper. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear a sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;ve gone then, but I doubt it,&#8221;
I replied, and then as a suspicion flashed on me, I
turned to Ivan. &#8220;What about the upper storey. Are
there any ladders about the place long enough to
reach it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur, at the stables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That explains the silence then. Come with me
quickly;&#8221; and climbing the barricade I rushed up,
followed closely by Ivan. We were in the nick of
time.</p>

<p>They had already planted a long ladder reaching
to the window of one of the front rooms and three
of them were more than half-way up. I threw the
window open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, gentlemen, quicker please. You keep us
waiting,&#8221; I called.</p>

<p>The result was almost comical. The man at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
top muttered something to those below him, and in
an instant all three went sliding helter-skelter to the
ground, and picking themselves up scurried off in the
darkness to cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be in a hurry to try that again,&#8221; I
said as I closed the window; &#8220;but we must watch
them. Let one of the men come up here and keep
a lookout;&#8221; and I went down again to Boreski.</p>

<p>Another long wait followed during which we heard
plenty of movement in the room close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s doing,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I wish to Heaven
we knew what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to speak to them again,&#8221; he replied, and
made a second attempt with no better result.</p>

<p>Later, Helga sent for me. I found she had got
the women-servants well in hand and all were engaged
in keeping a vigilant watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can see them going up and down that ladder,
and each man seems to carry something up and
come down empty handed. See,&#8221; and she led me to
a small barred window from which I could see the
ladder.</p>

<p>What I saw made me catch my breath. A couple
of men went up with an armful of straw and a third
followed with a bundle of small wood. They were
going to set fire to the house. I did not speak this
thought to Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to find out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m afraid, I suppose? You know
that they mean to set the house on fire, and you won&#8217;t
say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that I&#8217;ll find the way to stop that. Call
to me the moment those three men come down again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I returned to Boreski and told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must enter that room and stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go in by the dressing-room door and take
Ivan. I&#8217;ll take this man. When I call to you, get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
in as fast as you can. Turn out all the lights here or
they&#8217;ll see us enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out they went promptly and we stood in the darkness
waiting for Helga&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve come down, monsieur,&#8221; she called a few
minutes later, and in a trice I had turned the key and
burst into the room.</p>

<p>The luck was ours. The room was empty. Never
dreaming that we should venture in, they had left it
unguarded. All round the sides were piled heaps of
straw and dry wood, ready to be fired, and the evidence
of their dastardly trick lay plain to our eyes.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Helga&#8217;s quickness the infernal
plan would have been successful.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have them now,&#8221; I said eagerly to Boreski.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll trap them here. They&#8217;ll be back in a moment.
We&#8217;ll wait and give them an unexpected
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hid in the darkness, the four of us, and presently
heard the sound of heavy feet mounting the
ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No shooting,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;Just seize them.
We may catch more by-and-by in the same trap. And
wait until all are in the room. Silence like death, till
I move.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a sound escaped us, and for my part I held
my breath when the head and shoulders of the first
man appeared at the open window, and he stepped
all unsuspecting into the room; and a second and
then a third followed, each with his bundle of straw
or wood as fuel.</p>

<p>One of the men came so near me to deposit the
burden that he almost touched me, and as he stooped
to put it down, I gave the signal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; I cried in a loud voice and sprang upon my
man. A scene of wild tumult followed as the series
of tough struggles commenced. The men fought hard,
and we stumbled and tumbled and wrestled in the
darkness, blundering hither and thither, taking and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
giving fierce blows, often knocking up against one
another, mingled at times in dire confusion, all straining
with desperate effort, breathing hard and speaking
scarce a word save when some sharp ejaculation
of anger or pain, or a violent oath leapt from between
tight-clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Ivan was the first to beat his man, and soon afterwards,
as my hand chanced to knock against a heavy
billet of wood, I seized it and dealt my antagonist a
blow on the head which laid him out.</p>

<p>I was considering how to use the victory when
some one came to the foot of the ladder, ran up a
few rungs, and called&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Start the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same instant a tremendous crash was heard
in the lower part of the house, followed by loud
screams from the women and the gruff tones of men.
Then Helga&#8217;s voice came loud and piercing, calling
to me for help.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">CONCERNING THE
VALUE OF HOSTAGES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE noise in the house below ceased with ominous
suddenness as I started to rush down in
response to Helga&#8217;s cry for help.</p>

<p>What to do with our prisoners embarrassed me for
a moment. Every one of us might be needed below,
and my first idea was to leave the men as they were.
But happily I did not do that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan, you must come with me. M. Boreski, will
you and the servant watch the men here and try to
find some means of securing them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is plenty of rope in one of the rooms above,&#8221;
said Ivan to the servant as we two hurried out.</p>



<p>The landing and stairs were dark, and we found
the men we had left on the landing had clambered
over to our side of the improvised barricade, where
they were waiting, revolver in hand, in expectation
of an attack from below.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not safe to go down, my lord,&#8221; said one of
them. &#8220;They are waiting for us below there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the women in danger, you cowards?&#8221; I
cried angrily, my thoughts on Helga. &#8220;Follow me,&#8221;
and I sprang over it and ran down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, mademoiselle,&#8221; I called as I ran,
but no answer came. Ivan kept by my side, and as
we reached the bottom some men sprang right at us.
There were six or seven of them at least, and for a
few moments we were in the thick of a pretty stiff
fight. All four of us were struck several times, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
finding it impossible to beat them, desperately as we
fought, we had to retreat, losing one of the two servants
who was made a prisoner.</p>

<p>Ivan fought like a fiend incarnate, kicking, lunging
and using the butt end of his heavy revolver with
tremendous effect, and but for him I should have
been made a prisoner. I was surrounded and held
by three of the men when he dashed in, and scattering
them with his tremendous strength, rescued me
and dragged me up the stairway.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the landing, monsieur,&#8221; he said; &#8220;our only
chance;&#8221; and back we had to go, scrambling headlong
up the stairs as best we could; while our assailants,
exasperated at our escape, fired shot after shot
after us.</p>

<p>That we were not hit seemed a miracle. The darkness
alone can have saved us, aided no doubt by the
excitement which prevented the men below firing
steadily.</p>

<p>We had saved our skins but had failed in what to
me was vastly of more importance&mdash;the rescue of
Helga and the others; and the failure so maddened
me that for the time I was incapable of consecutive
thought. I was conscious chiefly of a fierce animal
desire to wreak my vengeance upon the cowards who
had captured her, and hugged the thought to my
heart that I could certainly kill some of them. In
other words I was for the moment almost out of my
mind with baffled rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must save the mademoiselle, monsieur,&#8221; said
Ivan at length, perplexed by my silent inactivity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or avenge her. My God, if anything has happened
to her, they shall pay dearly,&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do next, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>That question was soon settled for us, however;
for suddenly lights appeared below and relieved the
dead gloom of the landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to attack us,&#8221; whispered Ivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shoot this time and shoot to kill, Ivan,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
said, speaking out fierce wrath and with a sort of
devilish pleasure at the prospect.</p>

<p>But the attack tarried, and while we waited Boreski
came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have secured those three,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring them out and shoot them,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;The others have taken mademoiselle and the
Duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be no good to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring them out,&#8221; I rejoined fiercely; and when
he hesitated I added, &#8220;Then I will;&#8221; and I went
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t do murder,&#8221; he said, and
Ivan followed in.</p>

<p>I paid no heed to the words, and seizing the first
man I dragged him out, bound as he was, and dashed
him down on the ground. The mere recourse to this
brutality seemed to give relief to my rage, and I went
in again and brought out another, treating him just
as brutally. I was for the while both bully and coward
in my frenzy.</p>

<p>When I got out I found Boreski speaking to some
one below. I leaned forward and tried to see the
speaker, and had I been able, I believe I should have
shot him on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know whom we seek,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;Give
him up to us and we will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked Boreski.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. I speak for those who are with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for all of them,&#8221; said I, interposing with an
unholy laugh. &#8220;We have three here who would like
to speak for themselves. Come up and ask them why
your scheme to fire the house has failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>My reply seemed to produce far more effect than
the sneer itself warranted, for we heard the men draw
together and speak in low but excited tones. Suddenly
the reason for this flashed upon me. I had
spoken in Russian, and my accent had betrayed me
for a foreigner.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="allsmcap">THE SUDDENNESS OF THE ACTION TOLD, AND PERHAPS THE<br />
RECKLESSNESS OF IT HELPED ME.</span>&#8221;&mdash;<a href="#Page_133"><i>Page 133.</i></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>At last I began to see the way out of it all, and my
strange frenzy rapidly subsided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming, gentlemen?&#8221; I cried again.
&#8220;We can promise you a merry welcome which will
save some of you at least the trouble of returning.
Or do you find it easier to gag women than to face
men?&#8221; and I continued to pour in a broadside of
sneers and taunts, speaking all the time in Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that speaking, Boreski?&#8221; came at last in
the same gruff deep voice that had spoken before.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man you have been fools enough to mistake
for the Emperor,&#8221; I answered with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boreski, why do you not answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him the truth, M. Boreski,&#8221; said I in a tone
loud enough to reach those below.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell them, it will turn their vengeance upon
you for Vastic&#8217;s death,&#8221; he said in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better upon me than upon mademoiselle,&#8221; I replied
quickly, in the same loud tone. &#8220;I am not afraid
of the truth. Tell them I fooled you as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not whom you think,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Grace of God!&#8221; exclaimed the man below.</p>

<p>Realizing the effect which the discovery had produced,
and believing firmly in the eloquence of acts,
I obeyed my next impulse, and jumping over the barricade
ran half-way down the stairs and stood where
the light from below shone upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show you for yourselves,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the action told, and perhaps the
recklessness of it helped me. The men stared up at
me as if astounded, and for a moment not one of them
moved. Then two revolvers were raised and levelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay,&#8221; I cried in a loud voice of command. &#8220;If
you fire at me it will be the sentence of death on your
three comrades up there,&#8221; and I pointed up the stairway.
&#8220;You understand, Ivan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the living God, I do,&#8221; he answered, and his
voice, tremulous with earnestness, heightened the
effect of the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>It was just one of those positions which a little
impudence and bluff will carry when everything else
may fail.</p>

<p>The leader of the men growled out a word, and the
two revolvers were lowered. Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the devil with your who are you? You can
see who I am not, and that should be enough for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Vastic&#8217;s murderer,&#8221; said one of the men
then, and murmurs of rage followed. I recognized
the speaker as Vastic&#8217;s companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were with him, say what you saw,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you shoot him like a dog,&#8221; said the fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie, and you know it,&#8221; I cried sternly. &#8220;I
did not shoot him until he was in the act of shooting
me. He mistook me, as you all have, for the Emperor;
and it was his life or mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more angry murmuring at this, and I
thought the men would break away from the leader&#8217;s
control. I have never been nearer death than at that
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down that we may see you better,&#8221; said the
leader next.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see me quite well enough here; but as
you will. Ivan, remember, three lives for mine,&#8221; I
called, and I went down deliberately and stood face
to face with them at very close range; and a very
ugly-looking lot they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not the Emperor, God curse him,&#8221; cried one
of the gang.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not even a Russian,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221; demanded the leader sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my own concern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will know it,&#8221; he insisted threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;While you threaten me, I&#8217;ll see you damned before
I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; This was only another bluff. It
would be useless to deny my name. Helga had spoken
it before Vastic&#8217;s companion. But I dared not yield<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
to the man&#8217;s threats. A single symptom of weakness
and the whole bluff would be exposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You carry things daringly,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three reasons for it&mdash;up there,&#8221; I retorted
grimly. &#8220;You can take my life if you will and
if you dare. You are all known well enough, and
foreigners of my position are not murdered in cold
blood without full penalties being exacted. Shoot, if
you&#8217;ve a mind to face the public executioner. If you
haven&#8217;t, let&#8217;s put an end to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You killed our comrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and three more will die if you kill me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the trump card. I could see that. He
had sneered when I had spoken of the executioner;
but there was no sneer for this. He presented indeed
the very type of concentrated furious perplexity.
Like the rest, he was willing enough to kill me; but
he believed my threat would be carried out; and fear
for his comrades alone saved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you still refuse your name?&#8221; he asked; and
I believe he was utterly at a loss what to do or say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not through fear of your knowing, but I allow
no man to threaten me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell it me then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when you speak in that tone. My name is
Denver; I am an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you to be here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under circumstances which led to my being regarded
as the Emperor. Among those who fell into
the mistake was the spy, Drexel, whose report to you
has caused all the havoc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present, alive. How long he lives depends on
you.&#8221; He liked this answer no better than my former
threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a fearful mistake,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which you have done your worst to add to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You admit you killed M. Vastic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t attempted to hide it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>&#8220;For that you and all concerned will have to answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am alone responsible. You know that. The
man who was there knows it well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are suspiciously anxious to shield others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell the truth, that&#8217;s all. But come,&#8221; and I resumed
my former tone of authority; &#8220;we have talked
enough. Are we to resume this fight, or will you leave
the house and take your men away with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you dictating to me?&#8221; he asked, with a start
of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; for I hold the whip hand,&#8221; I flung at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget your life hangs by a thread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are four threads and four lives,&#8221; I retorted;
and again he winced and bit his lip, and was silenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we go you must go with us,&#8221; he said after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not alive, nor alone;&#8221; and I pointed this with a
look he could read.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will release our comrades?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could have laughed aloud as I heard this. It was
the proof that I had beaten him. But I answered as
sternly as I could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for you to dictate to me. Put mademoiselle
and the rest back in the house here; then take
your men away with you. When I am satisfied no
treachery is intended, the three prisoners shall be
released.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the living God of Heaven you shall answer
for all this,&#8221; he cried in a frenzy of rage. But impotent
anger of this sort was nothing to me. I had
him on the hip, and he knew it; and if he chose to
vent some of his wrath in words, let him.</p>

<p>He stood many moments in desperate doubt, seeking
for some other way out of the maze; but he found
none, and he turned at length to consult his fellows.
The conference was angry and excited, but no talk or
excitement could alter the fact that to harm me meant
the death of their three comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>Muttered oaths were as thick as corn on the cob;
fierce threats were levelled at me, accompanied by
glances of bitter hate. Once the counsel of violence
seemed likely to prevail, and the looks and gestures
grew so menacing that I intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are listening, and ready, Ivan?&#8221; I called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur, quite ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was enough. The gesticulations ceased, and those
who were against violence had once more the upper
hand.</p>

<p>After that the end came soon.</p>

<p>Two of the men went out and returned with Helga,
the Duchess Stephanie, and the women-servants.</p>

<p>Helga&#8217;s face lighted when she caught sight of me
as the knot of men fell back and made way for them
all to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one has been hurt?&#8221; I asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not hurt; badly scared, some of us,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;But what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been arguing on the subject of hostages,
and these gentlemen have taken my view of the subject.
There will be no more fighting. Will you all
go upstairs for a few minutes?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the men were leaving the house, I called one of
the grooms down and told him to saddle a couple of
horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall ride a few miles with you,&#8221; I told the
leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not trust me?&#8221; he said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my country we see to things for ourselves;
that&#8217;s all. Ivan,&#8221; I called, &#8220;if I do not return in
an hour, you will understand there is trouble. You
will know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try my temper,&#8221; said the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely a business precaution,&#8221; I replied lightly,
and went out with him to the stables.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like your business precautions,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You carry them too far.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>&#8220;The fact is I wish to speak to you, and what I
have to say cannot be said in the hearing of others.
I can say it as we ride together.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had some very pertinent questions to put to him,
indeed, and when he had found his horse and the
groom and I had mounted, I told the latter to fall
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; I said, as we all started, &#8220;I want to know
what is to be the result of this night&#8217;s work, so far
as I am concerned.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XV</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE DANGERS THICKEN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY companion was in no hurry to answer the
question and we rode some distance before he
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t you speak of this before the others&mdash;I
mean those in the house at Brabinsk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you all discuss your plans at public
meetings? I suppose because you want to keep them
secret. So do I now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you lay such stress on secrecy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because my own safety is my own concern, and
no one else&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a secret police spy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; had I been, do you think I should have been
in command of things at Brabinsk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you. I am an American; I have got
mixed up in this thing and want to get out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You killed M. Vastic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I was such a fool as to want to kill
him? I had no feud with him, nor have I with you.
It was a question whether he shot me&mdash;thinking I
was the Emperor&mdash;or whether I got in first. And I
had the drop on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our comrades do not die unavenged,&#8221; he said
with a grim significance anything but pleasant to notice.
I chewed the reply a while in uneasy silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may take that as a declaration of war between us.
You mean you will try to have my life for his. Not
a pleasant lookout&mdash;for either of us.&#8221; The pause
and the last words touched him on the raw.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>&#8220;We Americans make ugly enemies when we&#8217;re
put to it. I know every man of you by sight, and
have a rare memory for a face&mdash;when I want to
remember it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God of the dead and living, have a care, monsieur,&#8221;
he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan knows them too, and is a staunch friend of
mine,&#8221; I returned very quietly and meaningly; and
when he made no reply, I added: &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a
sample of American methods to-night, and if it comes
to any of this vendetta business, I&#8217;ll put up a good
hand. You may gamble on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you to be there as the Emperor?&#8221; he
asked after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;For reasons that don&#8217;t in the least concern you
or your comrades; so you needn&#8217;t ask for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another pause followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I happen to have a good deal of influence with
very high authorities. It would be a mistake to drive
me to use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angered by this, he thrust his hand to the pocket
where I had seen him stow his revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not,&#8221; I said coolly. &#8220;The same
authorities who will help me living would avenge me
dead. You are all known. Besides, there are the
three men at Brabinsk; and Ivan will keep his word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He growled out something, an oath, I think, but he
drew his hand back and rode on, presently asking
abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A truce to the whole thing&mdash;for all concerned
on both sides. Let it end right here. The thing, as
you said, has been a terrible mistake. Let it stop at
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not in my power to say.&#8221; He appeared
to speak with some regret, and after thinking a while
added: &#8220;No, it is impossible. If M. Vastic had not
been shot, it might have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had not expected to make much headway, so I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
was not very disappointed, and went on to try and get
at what was the real object of my questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you yourself regret the thing,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;You mean, I suppose, that if it rested with you, your
decision would be for a truce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it would. But the death of M.
Vastic is too heavy a blow for the brotherhood. You
will be all held to account for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All. It was my act alone. You mean I shall be
accountable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in my voice must have betrayed me, for
he started, and turning in his saddle looked at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the others to you? The mademoiselle,
for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are nothing to me,&#8221; I answered as if indifferently;
&#8220;except that I have brought this thing on
them and shall see them through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give yourself a troublesome commission,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lot of damned cowards,&#8221; I cried. It
was a feeble thing to say, but it relieved my feelings,
and soon afterwards I reined up my horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back,&#8221; I said curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, monsieur. As a man I am sorry for
what has happened and for what may have to come.
I hope we may not meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till we do. Your sorrow may be wanted
for your own side;&#8221; and without waiting for more,
I wheeled my horse round and set off back at a gallop
followed by the groom. And I took back with me a
very anxious heart and a whole crowd of perplexing
doubts and harassing fears.</p>

<p>Turn which way I would, dangers of some kind
blocked the path&mdash;dangers for Helga or myself separately
when they did not threaten us both in common.</p>

<p>I had had a fairly adventurous life, and in my time
had run up against some ugly risks; but these had
been of the nature of sudden emergencies to be met
promptly and overcome. But never before had I been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
called upon to face such a danger as this threatened to
be&mdash;enduring, shadowy, secret and all encompassing.
And I am not ashamed to admit I was considerably
shaken.</p>

<p>It is one thing to take your life in your hands, at
a crisis, face the music and fight for all you are worth
while the bother lasts; and quite another to pit yourself
against a secret society, to find the music a perpetual
dirge, threatening constantly to develop into
your own funeral march, and to breakfast, dine and
sup, walk, sit and sleep, talk, laugh and be merry with
the cold circle of a revolver barrel pressed to your
forehead.</p>

<p>But it had to be done, it seemed, so long as I remained
in Russia, and how long that would be must
depend upon an extremely explosive contingency&mdash;Helga&#8217;s
intentions.</p>

<p>My hope was to get her to give up her country and
adopt mine; but it was impossible to be sanguine.
They say a woman can bear pain far better than a
man, and it seemed to me that, given the requisite
courage and a sufficient motive, she could also bear the
strain of ever-present danger with greater fortitude.</p>

<p>So far as I could judge, Helga had been for years
risking the kind of danger which now loomed upon
me as so formidable; and I saw very little reason to
believe she would regard the new development as anything
worse than just a fresh complication which had
to be faced, and from which she would steadily refuse
to run away.</p>

<p>When I got back to the house I very soon had
reason to see that this was her frame of mind, and
that there was more in this visit of the Duchess
Stephanie than I had yet had time to learn.</p>

<p>The night&#8217;s experiences, coupled with his wife&#8217;s
arguments and entreaties, had made an end of Boreski
as a conspirator. He had persuaded himself, or she
had persuaded him, which came to the same thing,
that he had now nothing to hope for from the elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
scheme by which he had designed to force the
Imperial consent to his marriage and everything to
gain by abandoning it. I found the two of them importuning
Helga to take a similar view; and some
high words seemed to have passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall leave Russia for a time,&#8221; the Duchess
was saying as I entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are right to go under the circumstances,&#8221;
agreed Helga. &#8220;But what has occurred
to-night has not weakened my position by a thread.
The key of everything is the possession of these
papers which the Government dare not allow to fall
into other hands than their own. I still possess them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But even if you persist, you cannot use them,
Helga,&#8221; cried the Duchess Stephanie. &#8220;These wretches
alone would not let you live to do that. I declare I
tremble all over when I think of that fearful time
when we were in their power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? They did us no harm. They just stopped
us from crying out, took us over to the stable and
locked us in with a guard until the mistake was discovered.
As soon as that was plain, they released us
and left the place. Surely it is no very awful thing
to be locked up in a stable for an hour. It is not like
a prison or a Siberian hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget what I told you, mademoiselle,&#8221; said
Boreski; &#8220;that the men left us and released you only
because we had caught three of their number and M.
Denver threatened to have them shot. They would
never leave you in peace&mdash;nor us, indeed, if we were
to remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think that, by all means leave the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a spice of contemptuousness in Helga&#8217;s
reply, although spoken with apparent earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, M. Denver?&#8221; asked Boreski.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think as you do, that that is the only safe
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will at any rate please M. Denver&#8217;s friends
among the authorities,&#8221; said Helga, with a flash at
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>&#8220;We owe our liberty to M. Denver and probably
our lives as well, and I don&#8217;t think you should say
such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>This from the Duchess Stephanie surprised me
vastly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We also owe it to him that the dangers ever arose
at all,&#8221; retorted Helga quickly. &#8220;But I congratulate
him upon having won you over so completely to his
side that you forget that. My memory is longer. But
by all means take his advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall help you best by taking no part in this
discussion. There is still something to be done,&#8221; I
said, and left the room, in the middle of a protest by
the Duchess Stephanie against what she termed Helga&#8217;s
rank ungenerosity.</p>

<p>It was the truth of Helga&#8217;s bitter words that hurt
me. I had caused the trouble and brought the danger
upon them, and I knew only too well that the danger
was but averted for a time.</p>

<p>I went in search of Ivan, and with him released our
prisoners and Drexel and saw them well away on
their return to the city. As we went back to the house
Ivan said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not let the mademoiselle remain here,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Ivan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The brotherhood, monsieur. They will hunt her
down, and you and M. Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think them really dangerous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great God of my fathers, can any one doubt it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of yourself, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is to be will be,&#8221; he answered with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you don&#8217;t care?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the storm rages over the forest, monsieur,
it is the big trees which feel it and fall, the little trees
are passed over. I am only a little one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to have money to fly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord of all Powers, if I had not seen you to-night,
I should think you a coward to give such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
counsel. I am not a cur, monsieur, but a watchdog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said it merely to test you, and I ask your pardon.
I was certain of your answer, though. We shall work
together to save the mademoiselle. But if we are to
succeed, you must not do again what you did to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, monsieur?&#8221; he asked, not understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told her my plan and brought her to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you would have thrown away your life,
and would not let me go with you, monsieur. What
else could I do?&#8221; and he shrugged his great shoulders.
&#8220;But I will follow you now anywhere and
obey you implicitly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present I do not know what to do. I see no
way, Ivan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will think of something&mdash;or Mademoiselle
Helga will. But she should not stay here. There
are places where she can hide safely, monsieur. We
have done it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we shall see,&#8221; I answered a little hopelessly
as we entered the house.</p>

<p>Helga was waiting for us in the hall, and seemed
angry and excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan, get M. Boreski&#8217;s carriage, and, if he wishes
it, go with him to the city. He starts as soon as possible.
M. Denver will probably go with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ivan looked the picture of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yourself, mademoiselle?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I say, Ivan, and at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went away without a word but he glanced
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, mademoiselle,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid I am rather too tired for so long a drive just
at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreski and the Duchess came out as I finished and
caught the last few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not very long, M. Denver, only some three
hours at most,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the Duchess will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
very glad of your company. It will be an added
protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will come, monsieur. It is really the
safest thing&mdash;in fact, the only safe thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better go,&#8221; declared Helga firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you wish to get out of the country as
soon as possible,&#8221; said the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as practicable, naturally,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;But
I have one or two things to arrange first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are wise you will lose no time about it,&#8221;
said Boreski, who was manifestly eager for me to accompany
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have completely forgiven me then for the
deception I practised upon you in coming here?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many things have happened since,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I have abandoned that part of my plan, and my wife
has found a way of escape from the difficulties which
troubled us. Our marriage need no longer be kept
secret. Indeed, the Emperor already knows of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The real Emperor,&#8221; put in Helga quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, we owe you much for to-night; I feel
that,&#8221; he continued, and went on to thank me in his
courteous and dignified manner. I was so entirely
surprised by this most queer and unexpected turn of
things that I could find nothing to say.</p>

<p>Then the Duchess turned to Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me make a last appeal to you, Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless, madame.&#8221; The reply was curt, decisive
and angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to keep them. It was I who
brought them to you, and they are mine. Why not
do as I say, throw yourself upon the Emperor&#8217;s mercy
and seek his forgiveness?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared from one to the other in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess saw the Emperor this morning,&#8221;
said Boreski to me in an aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had my decision, madame,&#8221; said Helga
coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re a very wicked woman. You want
to ruin me just when I have succeeded in everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make my position very invidious, mademoiselle,&#8221;
said Boreski, looking profoundly uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver, you have some influence with Mademoiselle
Helga,&#8221; said the Duchess to me. &#8220;Use it
now, I beg of you, to urge her to give back these
papers to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver has no influence with me,&#8221; declared
Helga. &#8220;The papers were obtained at my suggestion
and for my own purpose, and no power in
Russia shall drag them from me until that purpose is
accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have pledged my word,&#8221; cried the Duchess
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And have done your best to keep it. But the
papers must remain with me. Nothing can change
my resolve.&#8221;</p>

<p>We heard the carriage at the door then.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that in honour you should give them up,&#8221;
said Boreski.</p>

<p>Helga looked at him very angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid you good-night, M. Boreski,&#8221; she said stiffly.</p>

<p>But the Duchess, having tried ineffectually entreaties
and tears, had a last shaft in the quiver. She
laughed angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will do you no good. You have to account
for how you obtained them, and I will swear, if necessary,
that I forged them myself. You shall not ruin
me. We have been your dupes too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your carriage is waiting, madame. Good-night,
messieurs,&#8221; and with a bow which included me as
well as Boreski, she turned her back upon us and
went into an adjoining room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better go,&#8221; said Boreski.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a dangerous, deceitful, treacherous woman,&#8221;
exclaimed the Duchess passionately. &#8220;Come, M.
Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, madame, I am remaining,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>&#8220;You will repent it, monsieur,&#8221; she exclaimed
angrily as she swept past me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly, madame; but at present I see nothing
but congratulation in being able to number myself
among Mademoiselle Helga&#8217;s friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Emperor will hear of it from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreski lingered a moment as if wishful to speak
to me, but his wife called him sharply, and he contented
himself with a glance which may have meant
many things to him but nothing to me, and they
drove off.</p>

<p>I looked after the carriage thoughtfully and went
back into the house. Ivan was in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not go with the carriage, then?&#8221; I said
in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur, mademoiselle said, if M. Boreski
wished it, and he did not say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad, Ivan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, monsieur. I thought you would wish
it. What are we to do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I will see Mademoiselle Helga,&#8221;
and I went to the room where she was.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">HELGA&#8217;S DEFEAT</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WITH my hand on the door of the room where
Helga was, I paused. The thought crossed
my mind that I had not been alone with her since
the critical moment in which the cloud between us
had been swept away, and we had seemed to understand
intuitively each the other&#8217;s heart feelings.</p>

<p>The thought embarrassed me, and I turned back
to try and think my way to some definite practical
course of action.</p>

<p>The scene with the Duchess Stephanie had shown
me one thing clearly. The failure of Helga&#8217;s plans
was no longer to be set down solely to me. The
Duchess had herself seen the Emperor and patched
up peace with him, the chief condition of which had
been the restoration of the secret papers.</p>

<p>It appeared, therefore, that the Emperor and old
Kalkov had been working for the same end at the
same time by different methods. And if this were
so, it was equally clear that the wily old Prince had
misled me as to the Emperor&#8217;s cognizance of my part
in the affair. A course on his side which was quite
in keeping with Helga&#8217;s opinion and description of
his methods.</p>

<p>For my part I cared little; he might throw me
over if he pleased, and he had doubtless calculated
upon that as a probable contingency. But it affected
Helga very seriously now, because it had led the
Emperor to take a line with the Duchess which he
would never have taken, had Kalkov told him what
I was doing; and it had thus closed the gates against
Helga&#8217;s chances of getting to the Emperor himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>Up to the present Helga&#8217;s position had been veiled,
and if I could have secured her an interview, her story
might have been listened to with an impartial ear. But
now the Duchess was going in hot haste to prejudice
Helga in the Emperor&#8217;s eyes by pointing to her as the
real source of danger in regard to the papers.</p>

<p>In other words Helga&#8217;s scheme for the benefit of
Boreski by securing the Imperial consent to the marriage
had succeeded, while it had failed so far as it
concerned Helga herself. And the very success of it
made the failure for her all the more disastrous.</p>

<p>It seemed indeed that the further one went in the
whole affair the more hopeless and complicated and
dangerous it became.</p>

<p>The moment Helga&#8217;s real part in the matter was
told to the Emperor he would pass on the knowledge
to Kalkov, and the whole machinery of the Government&#8217;s
secret police and spies would be set in motion
for her detection and arrest.</p>

<p>And as if that were not enough, the ominous tangle
with the brotherhood had arisen at the same moment.</p>

<p>Between us we had made just a horrible mess of
everything; and as the more I pondered the thing
alone the more hopeless it looked, I went in at length
to Helga to see if I could get any ray of light from
her.</p>

<p>The way of a woman is ever a paradox surely, and
Helga was very much of a woman in that respect.</p>

<p>When I entered I found her stretched at full length
on a sofa in what appeared to me to be an attitude of
almost despairing dejection, and so preoccupied that
she did not hear me until I closed the door behind me.
Then she sat up quickly and looked at me. She had
great mastery over her features, and she evinced
neither pleasure nor surprise at sight of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten something and returned for
it?&#8221; she asked with a sort of conventional politeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Returned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were going with Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; My glance said more than my words.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess will have been disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her disappointment is nothing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; with a lift of the brows, as if in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;I have been thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have been better employed in getting
back to the city. You would have covered a third of
the distance by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going. I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it rather late?&#8221; She pointed this with a
glance at the clock.</p>

<p>I could not restrain a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this some new game we are playing?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She sat drumming her fingers on the sofa arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that what you want to talk about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I wish to ask you what you propose to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do not propose to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this very quietly and calmly, and then
suddenly flashed out&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I do can be no possible concern of yours,
M. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary it is everything to me,&#8221; I returned
firmly. &#8220;You know that as well as I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not know it; I will not have it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see. What are you proposing to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked as if about to make some sharp reply,
but with one of her swift changes, she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really wish to render me a service, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to render you many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go back to the Palace&mdash;to those who sent
you to me&mdash;and tell them you have failed in your
honourable and secret mission. Tell them of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, but that is not the kind of service I
was expecting you to ask, and I shall not do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no other that I care to ask, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you wish me to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought I not to be concerned for the safety of so
welcome a guest?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>&#8220;What extraordinary creatures you women are&mdash;and
you especially. Now if you were a man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God that I were!&#8221; she interposed vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I would just sit down and talk over the
whole mess, as two friends should, and try to hit on
the easiest and best way out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; she cried; but I took no notice of the
interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when we had hit on the solution we should
try to work together to carry it out. But instead of
that, here you are flying into a passion just because
I ask you what you mean to do; and then you insult
me for no reason that I can see or understand, except
that I haven&#8217;t run away like a coward, unless it is
that there&#8217;s nobody else around whom you can treat
in the same way with impunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I to throw myself on my knees in gratitude
to every one who chooses to force the offer of his help
upon me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it does you any good to say this kind of thing
to me by all means go on. Only try to concentrate
them into a few pithy and bitter sentences and get
them over. I can only say they don&#8217;t hurt me in the
least except that I know you&#8217;ll be horribly sorry for
them after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am serious when I say I wish you to leave here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d try a cigarette,&#8221; and I lit a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are intolerable,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have an agreement. This cigar will last
about twenty minutes or half an hour; suppose you
get through with all your nasticisms in that time,
and then discuss things soberly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you leave the house, M. Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will not&mdash;if it means leaving you
here. Nothing will shake my resolution to see you
through this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I tell you that your presence interferes
with my plans.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>&#8220;Good. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not have your help, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may surely choose whom I will to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t choose you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, but you have a tendency to repeat yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to provoke me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bit superfluous, surely. But if you would get
into a towering rage and be done with it, it might
help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare to insult me only because you think I
am defenceless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really think I wish to insult you, you are
the most extraordinary woman in Russia. You know
so much better than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to leave the house, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you will not go I will call my servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan will have no hand in such madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you would even try to turn my servants
against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My cigar is half through,&#8221; I said, very calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have no answer to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, none. Ivan or you yourself can find one
easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are insufferable,&#8221; she cried, her eyes flashing,
as she sprang to her feet. &#8220;I will not stay in the
room with you,&#8221; and she crossed to the door.</p>

<p>I went on smoking and would not even turn my
head to watch her. At the door she paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you leave my house, M. Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given you my answer already, Mademoiselle
Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not think you could be so grossly discourteous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal about me you seem to persist
in misunderstanding. But one thing you shall know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
clearly&mdash;that my will power is every whit as strong
as yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s precisely what I wish you to do, and Ivan
and I will go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the door and I rose and flung my cigar
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thrown the rest of it away. Now let us be
sensible and face things, and stop this wrangling.
Come and sit down again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. I will not be insulted.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked her very steadily in the eyes as I crossed
the room to her, and she may have divined something
of my thoughts, for it seemed to cost her an effort to
meet my gaze. And when I was close to her, she
shrank slightly and her fingers left the door handle.
I closed the door then, and she bit her lip and frowned
in the struggle to appear firm. After an intentionally
long pause, I said, slowly and deliberately&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been horribly unjust to me. In your
anger you have said things that I would suffer from
no one else. You know that, and&mdash;&#8221; I paused
and lowered my tone&mdash;&#8220;and you know why. We
both know why, Helga. We learnt it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should shake your head.
It has changed all my life for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? It is true&mdash;do or say what you
please. You are first in the world to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not hear you. I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t say it again. But it will always
be so. I just want you to feel that and to know it&#8217;s
in that spirit I wish to talk over things with you.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>That she was deeply moved she could not hide
from me. She stood with lowered head, her bosom
heaving, her lips trembling as she bit them, and her
fingers interlocked, until with a deep sigh she appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
to come to a decision, when she lifted her
face and answered steadily&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not pretend not to understand you; but I
cannot and will not accept your help. You must go
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not take that answer, and I will not leave
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke as I felt, quite resolved on that point.</p>

<p>The answer pleased her, and the hardness of her
face relaxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very obstinate,&#8221; she said, and her eyes
were almost smiling; certainly the light in them was
soft.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what we call it. It is the
thing that matters. Tell me frankly why you try
to refuse my help.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer directly, and her eyes were
troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will tell you. You have a right to know,&#8221;
and she recrossed the room to her former place. I
followed to mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far would you go with your help?&#8221; she
asked, leaning her chin on her hand and gazing at me
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know what that look has behind
it, but I can answer the question only in one way. I
wish you to be my wife, Helga, and let me help you
at every turn in life. I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And know nothing of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you are the one woman the world
holds for me. That is enough for me to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw me yesterday for the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be the same when yesterday is ten or
twenty years old. It is no question of mere time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I am not as other women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t love the other women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not mean that. You know. I mean I am
not a good woman&mdash;as women are counted good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am accustomed to form my own judgments
and to trust them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>&#8220;I should only ruin you. It is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until I am ruined and then see. But you
would not ruin me, on the contrary I should save you
from ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very self-confident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The directness of the reply seemed to please her,
for she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very concise, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no time to waste words. We have a
crisis to face.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, and her face hardened a little as if in
defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been wooed before&mdash;do you realize that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean I have led men on to woo me and have
jilted them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not love <i>them</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began with a flash of her
eyes which changed to a smile as she stopped abruptly.
It died away when I said nothing, and the air of
defiance returned. &#8220;It is that you will not understand
me. I did it to use them for the purpose of my life&mdash;and
when they were of use no longer I flung them
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not use me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to&mdash;at first,&#8221; and she threw up her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not at last then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you drive me to speak so plainly. I tell
you I am bad&mdash;bad to the core, heartless, heedless,
sexless if you will, where my revenge is concerned.
Now will you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, if you will have the full truth, you
shall. So long as I thought you were the Emperor
I set myself with all my woman&#8217;s wit and cunning
to make you love me. I planned it, schemed for it,
and knowing all that it might mean, I yearned for it.
I told you I would have made any sacrifice to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
won your power to my side. Now, perhaps, you see
how base a thing I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you have succeeded, and have made me
love you&mdash;though Heaven knows I needed no making.
What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, will nothing open your eyes and drive
you from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing; but you have not said it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me, and emotion seemed to master
her till she said passionately&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are no use to me. Had you been in truth the
Emperor, as God is my judge, I would have been
your mistress. But being what you are, I will not
be your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very anxious to blacken yourself in my
eyes,&#8221; I said after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;You at any rate shall know the truth&mdash;see me
for what I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you why, Helga. There are limits
even to the recklessness of your self-slander. I have
done you more wrong than I deemed. You had caught
yourself in your own toils and come to&mdash;to love
the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke slowly and deliberately, and as the words
left my lips she started as if to make some indignant
retort; but checked herself and leant back in her seat,
pale and set, her brows wrinkled in intensely earnest
thought. I watched her closely, and presently a flush
began to spread over her cheeks, and she said slowly,
without looking at me&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I deny it? You wish the truth and
shall have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she sat up again and bent forward toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I love you&mdash;if it be love to long to do what
you ask, and yet be strong enough to put all thought
of doing it out of my heart. I do love you, I believe,
and yet I am resolved never to look on your face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
again. I hate you for the deceit you practised, which
has ruined everything for me at the very moment
when all seemed to be won. And yet&#8221;&mdash;her voice
and eyes softened and she sighed&mdash;&#8220;and yet I&mdash;I
am glad you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask no more than that&mdash;at present. Except
leave to ask for more when I have undone the mischief
I have caused. You will grant that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no, a hundred times no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may make it a million. It will not alter
my resolve.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed with delicious softness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you know why I will not have your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I do not care. I mean to force it on you;
I will make it necessary to you. You have shown
me the road in what you&#8217;ve said. You will marry
me when I have helped you to revenge upon old
Kalkov. Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I said I would never marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you did, but that was because you declared
I was no use to you. I will make myself
of use. I accept your own terms, and from now on
I take hold of the thing and handle it in my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very masterful,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only American. I&#8217;ve a large interest in it
now, and on our side we believe in good management.
You&#8217;ve bungled things awfully, you see, made a holy
mess of them all round and wasted no end of opportunities.
For all I know you may have spoilt every
chance. But there&#8217;s still one way, and I shall try
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can manage my own affairs,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can mismanage them, you mean; I&#8217;m too
deep in now to trust your methods any longer. We
go my way from now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, and what is your way?&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe all women at heart like to be forced to
submit, and Helga&#8217;s manner now was a curious mixture
of the resentment which her pride dictated and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
pleasure at meeting a will just a bit stronger than
her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to get you to the Emperor before
the Duchess can prejudice him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind how, I&#8217;m going to do it. What you
have to do is to go and get some sleep. You can
have three hours, and then you must be ready to start,
and Madame Korvata must be ready too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let you talk any more,&#8221; and I
got up and opened the door.</p>

<p>She rose and laughed with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new sensation to be ordered in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In three hours we shall start,&#8221; was my reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;My nerves are tingling with desire to rebel,&#8221; she
said, as she came across the room slowly, and when
she reached the door she stood and looked at me,
smiling. &#8220;Do all you Americans make&mdash;make love in
this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the business man at present; the lover will
come afterwards. You won&#8217;t mistake him when his
turn comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Monsieur&mdash;l&#8217;Empereur,&#8221; she cried,
her look a challenge and her whole expression radiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will make the lover rush things, Helga, if
you look at the business man like that. You ought
to be asleep already. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep? After to-night!&#8221; and with a toss of
the head she was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">AT THE GATES OF
THE PALACE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS soon as Helga was gone I sent for Ivan, and
told him to have everything in readiness for
the start in three hours&#8217; time; and that of course he
would go with us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going, monsieur?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. You spoke of some places where
mademoiselle could safely lie hid for a while. Which
is the safest and nearest to Petersburg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a house in the city itself, in the Square
of San Sophia, monsieur; quite safe, if the mademoiselle
will adopt her old disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What disguise is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Sister of Charity, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it safe from both the police and the brotherhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we could go there. Is it ready for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can send on a carriage with a couple of the
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; then see to it at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we leave here, there is one thing, monsieur.
Have you forgotten&mdash;the body of Vastic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, I had forgotten. Go and see to
the other things, and I&#8217;ll think what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a prickly problem in truth. To leave it
at Brabinsk appeared out of the question; to bury it
and try to hush the thing up equally impossible; and
to take it with us to the city more hazardous than
either. He threatened to be as much trouble to us
dead as alive, and I smoked a cigar and tried to think
the thing out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>My intention was to make a clean breast of the
matter to Kalkov, leaving him and his police to do
what they liked; and I did not doubt they would find
little difficulty in arranging matters.</p>

<p>But where should I tell them to look for the body?
To bring them after it to Brabinsk would only put
them on the scent after Helga, a result full of dangerous
possibilities.</p>

<p>Yet how to get it away? It occurred to me that
Ivan and I might carry it off some miles from the
house and hide it in a wood or pond or somewhere;
but the personal risks attending such a venture were
too considerable, and in a way unnecessary.</p>

<p>Thus in the end I was driven back upon the decision
to leave it at Brabinsk; and Ivan and I had to undertake
the exceedingly gruesome and revolting task of
burying it under the floor of a distant out-house.</p>

<p>I shall not readily forget that experience. Ivan
was cool enough; but for my part I felt nearly as
bad as any murderer could have felt when seeking to
hide the body of his victim; and when I got back
to the house, a stiff glass of brandy was necessary
to enable me to shake off the feeling of chilly horror.</p>

<p>Then I had to plan my further movements.
Roughly, my intention was to get back to the
Palace and obtain an audience of the Emperor at
the earliest possible moment, and beg him to see
Helga.</p>

<p>Prince Kalkov I did not wish to see until after that.
I took Helga&#8217;s view of matters, and believed that
if she could get the story of her father&#8217;s ruin straight
to the Emperor, before the Duchess Stephanie could
influence him, she would succeed in working upon
his old friendship for her father sufficiently at least
to cause some kind of investigation into the affair.</p>

<p>But in that we should have to reckon with Prince
Kalkov, of course; and he would be an ugly enemy.
Fight he would, naturally, to the last gasp; and
his influence, position, and parts would ensure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
such a struggle would be a desperate one. It was
like challenging the whole force of the Government;
and however good our case might be, there were a
hundred things likely to arise to defeat us.</p>

<p>When I am trying to think out a course coolly, I
have an unfortunate knack of seeing all the dangers
and obstacles through a kind of mental magnifying
glass; and I saw so many now, and they all appeared
so great that I could only regard our chances as little
short of hopeless.</p>

<p>Then added to everything was this infernal Nihilist
complication. Not only would it afford Kalkov a
lever of tremendous power against Helga, but it
threatened to dog our every movement with perilous
personal risk.</p>

<p>It was in this respect that Vastic&#8217;s death was so
threatening. The instant I told Kalkov of it he would
be in possession of the fact that Helga was implicated
with the brotherhood. He would recognize in a moment
the importance to him of denouncing his accuser
as a Nihilist of the Nihilists, and would find or invent
a thousand proofs in support of the charge; and her
whole case would be instantly tainted and ruined.</p>

<p>The one thin slender chance of averting this catastrophe
was to hide the fact that Helga Boreski the
Nihilist and Helga the daughter of Prince Lavalski,
the Emperor&#8217;s former friend, were identical; but even
this forlorn hope would be cut off when the Duchess
Stephanie got to the Emperor and told her story.
Boreski himself knew all about it, and in all probability
had told his wife.</p>

<p>Still, whatever we might attempt, there were big
risks, and we must be content to take them and deal
with them as they threatened us. The first consideration
was to get at the Emperor before the Duchess
and strike the first blow.</p>

<p>A glance at Helga&#8217;s face when she came down told
me she had not slept. She was very pale. I told her
where we were going, and added&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>&#8220;You have not taken my advice and got some
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to speak to you earnestly a moment. I
have been thinking. You must not do this thing
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give it up on one condition&mdash;only one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you give it up also, and, instead of going back
to Petersburg, you cross the frontier with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you know is impossible;&#8221; and her face
clouded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then; and don&#8217;t keep the carriage waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you are to run this risk, it will be so much
harder for me. I cannot bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as you remain on this side of the frontier
I remain too; so that you&#8217;ll have to bear it, I&#8217;m
afraid;&#8221; and I took her out to the carriage in which
Madame Korvata was already shivering in the nipping
morning air. That good lady was not in a pleasant
temper, moreover, at having been dragged from
her bed at such an early hour; and as she did not
know all that had occurred, and was not fully in our
confidence, Helga and I could not speak much during
the long drive.</p>

<p>Helga lay back in her seat most of the time wrapped
in thought, and I on my side was equally absorbed;
but once, when Madame Korvata had fallen asleep,
we exchanged a few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going straight to the Palace,&#8221; I told her;
&#8220;and shall do my utmost to get to the Emperor at
once. If I am successful I shall send immediately
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not succeed. Prince Kalkov will not
let you,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to evade him altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a vigilant watchdog, and all those about the
Palace are at his beck and in his service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall try to hoodwink him. I know I can
get to His Majesty. What you have to do is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
prepared with all the proof of Kalkov&#8217;s infamy&mdash;all
particulars, so as to hit right home at once, and as
hard as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid that I shall fail at such a moment&mdash;if
it ever comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will come. It shall,&#8221; I said firmly. &#8220;But there
is another thing. If we get our chance and yet fail&mdash;what
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me and paused before replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could answer your question as you wish, I
would. But I shall never give in. Nothing will ever
satisfy me but victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the greater reason, then, for me to do my
utmost now,&#8221; I answered; but she saw I was disappointed
at her reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It is the greater reason for you to abandon
the attempt and leave me to fight on in my own
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not how we Americans fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in America you know nothing of the conditions
of such a trouble as this. You do not yet know
the risks you run. If we attack Prince Kalkov and
fail, do you think he will not know how to wreak his
revenge upon us&mdash;upon all concerned? Ah, monsieur,
what can a Republican know of the ways of
Russia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to get an insight, at least,&#8221; I said
lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fight with your votes over there, and risk
perhaps some of your money; but here the stakes
are human life and liberty. God help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke so vehemently that Madame Korvata
awoke, and our conversation ended.</p>

<p>When we neared the city I told Helga I should not
drive with her to her destination, and asked her to tell
me exactly the location of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one knows the Square of San Sophia&mdash;close
to the cathedral. The house is called the Retreat,
and was formerly a mission house. A small
red-brick building in the north-east corner.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>I took out a scrap of paper and scribbled the words
&#8220;Retreat, Square of San Sophia, N.E. corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not writing it down. It is dangerous to
write addresses, my friend,&#8221; said Helga cautiously as
I put it in my pocket.</p>

<p>It was a very small thing, but it startled me. I
seemed to feel, as it were, the first chill of the atmosphere
of intrigue which the simple caution suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in English, and no eyes but my own will ever
see it,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it is dangerous,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;You are not
in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right. I&#8217;ll tear it up;&#8221; and I
took out what I thought was the paper, tore it up, and
was flinging the pieces out of the carriage when Helga
again stopped me, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all in one place. You have not been reared
in this school, my friend. It is safer to burn papers
which tell tales.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pieces with the writing on are gone already,&#8221;
I said, glancing at those still in my fingers. &#8220;See,
these are blanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not matter, but caution can never be
exaggerated.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tossed the remaining fragments away, and tried
to regard the incident as neither important in itself
nor significant of anything serious. But Helga&#8217;s evidently
sincere earnestness affected me; and the bothersome
trifle was in my thoughts when I left the carriage
soon afterwards, and she renewed her injunctions to
me to be cautious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not deceive yourself,&#8221; she said very earnestly
as we parted. &#8220;I know you will do your best for
me; I believe it with all my heart. But you do not
understand these things&mdash;and we may never meet
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I get into a mess I will contrive to let you hear
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in Russia, M. Denver. I shall wait, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
anxiously I cannot tell you, for news of you. And
if I get none, I shall not misunderstand. I repeat&mdash;we
may never meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not hear from me to-day, or at latest
to-morrow, you will know there is a check somewhere,
and you must fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be quite safe in the Retreat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can safely communicate with me at the
American Embassy. Remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not forget, and need not write it down,&#8221;
she answered with one of her smiles. &#8220;And do you
yourself remember&mdash;caution, such as you have never
had to use. Good-bye. May God prosper us and our
cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our love, Helga,&#8221; I added in the lowest of
whispers. A pressure of her fingers and a glance from
her eyes answered me.</p>

<p>The carriage drove off rapidly, and left me to set
about a task, which in its way was perhaps as difficult
as any that ever plagued the wits of a sorely perplexed
man.</p>

<p>It was still early in the morning, and I had to walk
some distance before I could secure a drosky. The
driver, when I told him to take me to the Palace, appeared
to think I was either some overnight reveller
who had not shaken off the effects of the drink, or
else a lunatic; for he laughed and swore good-humouredly,
and then flatly refused to do as I bade him.</p>

<p>While we were wrangling, I saw some police approaching,
and, having no mind to be interviewed by
them, I ended the dispute by giving him a double fare
and telling him to drive to a point near the Palace.</p>

<p>As we rumbled along innumerable difficulties suggested
themselves as obstacles to my gaining admission
to the Palace at all at such an hour; and the all
but hopelessness of doing so without Prince Kalkov
getting to hear of it was too patent to be denied.</p>

<p>The attempt had to be made, however; and as impudence
and a show of authority go for much in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Russia as elsewhere, I put as bold a face on things
as possible. When I left the carriage I wrapped my
military cloak about me, and strutting with as much
of an officer&#8217;s swagger as I could assume, I marched
past the first sentry without a question.</p>

<p>I returned his salute in an off-hand way and walked
on to the great building. Just as I thought my bluff
would succeed, however, I was stopped by an official.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, monsieur,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but no one is
permitted to enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I may go to my own rooms,&#8221; I replied
in French, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, but this is the Palace, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my rooms are in it. I am a guest of His
Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand pardons for this interruption, but we
have very strict orders, and have had no notification
of your visit. Will you be so good as to come to my
bureau?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather go to my rooms; but if this is the way
that His Majesty&#8217;s guests are usually treated, by all
means lead the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed very ceremoniously and took me to his
office. Here he repeated his apologies and asked me
my name.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will doubtless be some directions here,&#8221; he
added, taking a book from his desk.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to give my name if it could be helped;
and I hesitated.</p>

<p>He noticed the hesitation and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Harper C. Denver. I am an American.
I arrived here three days ago. You will probably
recognize this ring of His Majesty&#8217;s as a
guarantee of my position.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there are always two views as to the possession
of a Royal jewel; and this blockhead took the
wrong one. I might have known he would; and I
could almost read in his eyes that he suspected me of
having obtained it by some wrongful means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>He pretended to search in his book for some mention
of my name, while all the time he was asking himself
how I could have got hold of one of His Imperial
Master&#8217;s rings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret exceedingly that I find no reference here
to you,&#8221; he said, his manner still excessively polite.
&#8220;It is very awkward and very unfortunate. But I am
afraid I cannot permit you to enter the Palace&mdash;without
further instructions, that is. No doubt, however,
you can suggest some one to whom I can send?&#8221;</p>

<p>He said this with the air of a man who feels he has
got you.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can send to His Majesty,&#8221; said I quietly.
&#8220;That will be the simplest way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily, and his manner changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to see His Majesty, then, at once?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I wish is to go to my rooms first, and see
His Majesty afterwards. Nothing unreasonable in
that, is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unreasonable, no, monsieur, and yet, perhaps, unusual.
But I will see what I can do. I will send and
make inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had returned to his former polite deferential
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as you are quick, I don&#8217;t care what you
do,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very trying to me. I am deeply sorry.
But perhaps you are used to these needs for caution
in other countries;&#8221; and he went on in this style until
a servant entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send Gravok to me,&#8221; he said, and accompanied
the order with a significant nod.</p>

<p>I wondered what was coming; but was not long
left in doubt, for half a minute later a sergeant and
three soldiers entered, two of whom placed themselves
instantly one on each side of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a mere formality, of course; but you will
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>I laughed then.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean I am under arrest, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course; what else?&#8221; he answered in curt
quick tones. &#8220;Are you armed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a revolver; here it is,&#8221; and I put my hand
to take it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop him,&#8221; said the official sharply; and a soldier
caught my arm, while the sergeant plunged his hand
into the pocket I had indicated and drew out the
pistol.</p>

<p>The official smiled with dry significance as he examined
it and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, and loaded, I see. I expected it. Take him
to the guard-house.&#8221;</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">PRINCE KALKOV&#8217;S
WELCOME</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY first inclination was to burst out laughing
at the egregious absurdity of the blunder, but
I restrained myself. Had I had no one but myself to
think for, I would have had my laugh, if the next
minute had seen me in the deepest dungeon in Petersburg.
But I was carrying too many responsibilities.</p>

<p>There are certain classes of officials at whom it is
extremely dangerous to laugh. You meet them in
all countries; but on the continent of Europe, they are
able to resent your merriment practically by clapping
you into gaol and perhaps keeping you there. It is
safer consequently to laugh at unofficial people.</p>

<p>There was one quick way for me out of the bother,
to refer the thing to Prince Kalkov&mdash;and although I
was loth to take it, I saw immediately that I must
adopt that course or be marched off by the soldiers
who were only too ready to obey the command.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not permit yourself to commit this mistake,
monsieur,&#8221; I said, quietly, &#8220;or you will incur
the serious displeasure of Prince Kalkov, as well as
of His Majesty. I do not wish to bring trouble upon
so courteous an official, and consequently urge you in
your own interest to communicate with the Prince
without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world does a big name properly
used carry more terror than in Russia&#8217;s capital; and
I put all the authority I could into my tone and
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you to do with His Highness?&#8221; asked
the man, hesitating and yet suspicious, and motioning
to the soldiers to wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>&#8220;It happens to be the case that I have told you the
truth about myself and you have disbelieved me. You
have sent for these gentlemen and ordered my arrest.
I will overlook that insult if you send a letter which
I will write to the Prince. And if you will not, I warn
you in all seriousness that I can and will obtain from
His Majesty your dismissal and disgrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done no more than my duty,&#8221; he returned
sullenly. He was obviously unwilling to give way
before his inferiors, and yet secretly afraid to persist.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, monsieur, you are exceeding
your powers now. I have shown you how to obtain
instant confirmation of what I have told you from
the highest authority, and in the simplest manner.
Refuse, and take the consequences. I am like yourself
in one respect&mdash;my patience has its limits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had this upon you,&#8221; he said in the same tone,
as he fingered my revolver. &#8220;And, as I said, it is
loaded.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I am at your disposal. Take me to
the guard-house and send to me the officer of the
watch;&#8221; and I moved toward the door.</p>

<p>The sergeant himself had no liking for the job now,
however, and hesitated; and the official in a surly
tone gave in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can write,&#8221; he said, and laid paper and pen on
the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not write now,&#8221; I said curtly, for I began
to see another ending to the affair. &#8220;I gave you the
opportunity and you declined it. I will go to the
guard-house. His Majesty and Prince Kalkov shall
find me there, and you can explain. Come, gentlemen,
if you please; or shall I go alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>That any one should exhibit a preference to be
arrested was so novel an experience for Russian officialism
that they were all staggered. The official took
refuge in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you attempting a joke with me?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>&#8220;I do not joke with persons in your position,&#8221; I
retorted sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my duty,&#8221; he replied, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you deem it your duty to degrade Prince Kalkov&#8217;s
friend by imprisoning him, do it, monsieur&mdash;if
you dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an impossible position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have created it, and must find the way out.
But every minute I am detained here will count against
you with the Emperor;&#8221; and I pulled out my watch
as if to mark them off. He was sorely perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will consider the matter. Withdraw your men,
sergeant;&#8221; and they filed out again, the sergeant manifestly
relieved. &#8220;I will send to His Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do nothing of the sort, monsieur, now,&#8221;
I said. I saw that he was now practically convinced
of my good faith, and I meant to gain my end in my
own way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can enter the Palace, monsieur, but I must
retain this,&#8221; and he held up my revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;We Americans do not consent to be robbed even
in an Emperor&#8217;s Palace,&#8221; I retorted, bent on winning
with the honours of war.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be returned to you, monsieur; but I cannot
consent to allow you to pass with a weapon in
your possession. I dare not take the responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s reason in that, perhaps,&#8221; I agreed after a
pause. &#8220;You can keep it until I come to reclaim it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door for me then, and murmured an
apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for what has occurred, but you will
understand the difficulty in which I found myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not mention it, monsieur, I shall not;
but if you do I shall make the worst of it. In your
private ear I may tell you I have been away on urgent
business of the Prince&#8217;s, and he wishes neither my
departure nor my return to attract notice. I need say
no more to so zealous a servant of His Highness;&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
and I gave him a look which I hoped would secure
his silence.</p>

<p>I was passing out when a thought occurred to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will perhaps complete your satisfaction if you
accompany me to my suite of rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was more than pleased; and so was I, for by
this means I secured myself from all further interruption
at the hands of the numerous members of the
household whom we met on the way.</p>

<p>I had some difficulty in finding my rooms, but succeeded
at length, and taking my companion in with
me, was soon able to convince him thoroughly of his
mistake. He overwhelmed me with profuse apologies,
returned my revolver, begged me to overlook
his action, and what was much more important,
assured me I could depend upon his silence as to my
return.</p>

<p>It is always an intense satisfaction to turn a check
into an advantage, and I was disposed to plume myself
upon my adroitness and to regard the incident
as of good omen for the start of things.</p>

<p>I dressed myself in my own clothes once more, and
then had to consider how best to reach the Emperor.
I was, moreover, desperately hungry, and how to get a
breakfast puzzled me.</p>

<p>It is so often the little fiddling trivialities which
cause so much embarrassment. The servant who had
waited upon me before had been Kalkov&#8217;s confidential
man, Pierre, and I was naturally unwilling that he
should know of my return, as he would instantly inform
his master.</p>

<p>Some breakfast I must have, however, and to get
it I must of course ring the bell and take my chance.
The luck was with me this time. The man who came
was a stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have my breakfast served in my room this
morning,&#8221; I said in an off-hand tone, as if I had lived
in the Palace half my life. He was too well trained
to express any surprise even if he felt any; and in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
few minutes he returned with a breakfast and stayed
to wait upon me.</p>

<p>I ate the meal in silence, and then lighting a cigar
I said in a casual way&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not waited upon me before, I think. I
don&#8217;t recall your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been absent from the Palace, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that explains it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I returned the day before yesterday, monsieur,&#8221;
he said with a quick glance and in a significant tone
which showed his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, that was while I was away. Is His Majesty
recovered from his indisposition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the blessing of Providence, completely, monsieur,&#8221;
he replied earnestly. &#8220;But it was not serious,
happily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good news,&#8221; I said; but it struck me as
singular that his recovery should be complete before
my return. It seemed to lend some kind of confirmation
to my former suspicion that Kalkov had played
me false in regard to the Emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, you will be waiting upon me for the
future, I suppose?&#8221; I said after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of that,&#8221; and I gave him a couple of
gold pieces as a material proof of my pleasure. &#8220;I
wish to have an audience of His Majesty this morning.
Can you get my request to him? I will write
it. It is important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no difficulty, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wrote a note urging His Majesty to grant me an
immediate interview and handed it to the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know who I am, of course,&#8221; I said, with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness Prince Kalkov&#8217;s man, Pierre, told
me that the suite was reserved for M. Denver, an
American gentleman. But he described you differently,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean my beard. Yes, I had to shave it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
off. Well, get my letter to His Majesty as soon as
you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>All was going so easily that when he had taken
away the letter I indulged in a little pardonable jubilation,
as I ran hastily over the heads of what I had
to say to the Emperor.</p>

<p>It had not been so difficult, after all, to break
through the cordon with which the Prince surrounded
the Emperor; and my direct American methods had
done well.</p>

<p>If I could only succeed half as well with His
Majesty, Helga and I&mdash;and then my thoughts
branched off to her, and all other considerations
slipped out of my mind.</p>

<p>She was worth winning indeed, let the fight be as
stiff as it might. Victory now meant a life full of
radiant happiness with her&mdash;a veritable queen among
women. Let the price be what it might, it was worth
paying to see the light of loving gratitude which would
spring to her lovely face when I should claim her for
my own and take her in my arms and tell her that my
ways had conquered when hers had failed, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had reached somewhere about that point when
my rhapsodical reverie was interrupted by a knock
and the servant entered. I sprang to my feet eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness Prince Kalkov to see you, monsieur,&#8221;
he said, and in came the Prince, hands extended
and face beaming, as if in genuine hearty
welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear M. Denver, I cannot say how glad I am
to see you back again,&#8221; and he seized my hands and
shook them warmly. &#8220;I have been really anxious,
painfully anxious, about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the life of me I could not for the moment shake
myself free from the chagrin and disappointment
caused by his arrival and play up to the part of appearing
glad to see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to get back, Prince, I can assure
you,&#8221; I said, with a sort of tongue-tying hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
as his sharp eyes were playing about my face like the
blade of a skilful fencer round a novice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank my God you are alive and well, and have
suffered no more hurt than the loss of your beard.
How it has changed you!&#8221; and as he looked at me
his grim wily old features relaxed into a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I had to shave,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the Emperor no longer, monsieur. No
one will make that mistake again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that. I don&#8217;t care for the part
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means you have had an exciting time,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;There are two emotions which I make
a rule to deny myself rigidly, monsieur, and you
have made me break the rule. They are enthusiasm
and impatience. Now I am enthusiastic when I think
of your act; and impatient to hear your account
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I was very far from impatient to give it him,
and was indeed cudgelling my wits how to colour it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place I have a pretty heavy item against
you, Prince,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;For having let you embark in the thing, you
mean. My dear M. Denver, I give you my solemn
assurance I had no idea there would be anything like
this result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that. I mean the breach of the
agreement between us that Boreski&#8217;s carriage should
not be followed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that!&#8221; and he threw up his hands. &#8220;Yes,
that was bad. It failed; but those responsible for
the failure have paid the penalty. They should have
known that Boreski might bring one of those cursed
motor-cars and thus be able to distance pursuit. I
was served by short-sighted fools&mdash;and fools of that
kind I do not keep in my employment. When I heard
of it I was maddened.&#8221;</p>

<p>I let him run on in this way in the effort to draw
me on to a side issue, for my object now was to gain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
time in the hope that the summons to the Emperor
would come to interrupt the interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t refer to the failure, I mean the attempt.
You promised that no attempt should be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear M. Denver, I give you my word that the
thing was necessary. I should have done precisely
the same had you been in truth the Emperor himself.
Of course, you know, monsieur, that there are times
when the commands even of kings have to be secretly
disregarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave the last sentence with a kind of semi-confidential
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything of the etiquette which
surrounds kings, but I do know, Prince, had I not
trusted your word I should not have gone,&#8221; I replied
with the severe manner of a man with a genuine
grievance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am deeply sorry, monsieur, profoundly sorry;
but, as I say, I only treated you as I should my
august master. And what effect, then, had it? It
must have been serious, of course. I can tell that by
the stress you lay upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a breach of faith with Boreski.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand carelessly and smiled to show
his indifference to that.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was clever enough to elude the pursuit, and
had evidently come prepared for the trial of wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It made him suspicious, of course; and jaundiced
his view of the documents I had to lay before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you have failed with him, then. You
did not get the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not.&#8221; I spoke reluctantly, angry at the
adroit manner in which he had got at the pith of the
thing so quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very disappointing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes, very
disappointing. But I am sure it is no fault of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appeared to be quite earnest in expressing his
disappointment at the failure; but his manner of referring
to the papers was in such contrast to his former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
reference to them that I could not fail to be struck by
it. I jumped to the conclusion consequently that he
knew of the interview between the Emperor and the
Duchess Stephanie and thought they were still to be
recovered through her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it was no fault of mine,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am under a deep obligation to you, M. Denver,
for having made the attempt&mdash;an obligation which
will find expression in a way that I think you will
appreciate. I mean in regard to your projected journey.
Everything that the Government can do to help
that shall be done. I give you my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very good of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me very shrewdly as I spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not abandoned the idea, have you? I
know that many of your countrymen act on impulse,&#8221;
he said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abandoned it? Oh no. Why should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I did not know whether anything in your
present experiences might incline you to think our country
not as&mdash;as safe for travellers as some others.&#8221;</p>

<p>That there was something underneath his words
and his calm smiling suavity was as clear as an ant
in amber.</p>

<p>&#8220;One has to take risks, of course,&#8221; I replied
indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I mean is that if you would rather turn
back, you would of course have our protection to the
frontier. If, for instance, you thought you would
rather approach our Asiatic dependencies from the
other end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen nothing of the capital itself yet,
Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, comparatively nothing; but this is a bad
season of the year for Petersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some meaning behind that,&#8221; I said
pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I, M. Denver? You have told me
nothing yet of your experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>He was blandness itself, with just the necessary
shred of reproachful reminder of my omission.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am waiting to see the Emperor. I have asked
him for an audience this morning; and as my story
to you will take rather long in the telling, it would
be better to postpone it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty will be charmed, I am sure. Did you
hear of the <i>ruse de guerre</i> about his indisposition?&#8221;
and he smiled again.</p>

<p>I was getting to be rather afraid of these smiles
of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a paper was shown me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped it would be. I hoped it would be. It
was a rather ingenious bit of colour. But His Majesty
had to recover yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I returned,&#8221; I put in drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had to go to Moscow to meet the Crown
Prince, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean His Majesty is in Moscow?&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you not know it? The servant should have
told you this morning. These men are really addlepated
fools,&#8221; he cried with an excellent indignation,
as his sharp glittering eyes fixed on me. He was
enjoying my momentary confusion, I am sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not know it,&#8221; I answered, with difficulty
smothering an oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was overwhelmed with regret that you had
not returned before he went&mdash;the more so as he
knew you would have left Petersburg before his return.&#8221;
He continued to enjoy my discomfiture, for
a moment, and then added lightly: &#8220;But at any rate
there is one compensation for me. It will give ample
time for me to hear your story, for which, as I told
you, I am really impatient. Will you tell it here, or
would you like to come to my apartments?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, one place is as good as another,&#8221;
I answered, in any but an amiable tone.</p>

<p>I was no match for him at this game of fence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Already he had contrived to fill me with a kind of
fearsome speculation as to how much he had managed
to hear of my doings and concerning Helga. There
was suggestiveness in every word he uttered, and every
look and gesture he made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did the Emperor think I should not be in
Petersburg on his return?&#8221; I asked after a pause.
&#8220;You are perplexing me, Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him so, my dear M. Denver,&#8221; he replied,
as if frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spread out his hands and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we not find a reason in your interesting
narration? I have really never known myself to feel
so much impatience for anything of the kind before.
I entreat of you not to keep me in suspense.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he threw himself back in his chair and folded
his hands in the attitude of an interested listener and
looked to me to begin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIX</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">TURNING THE SCREW</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE I complied with Prince Kalkov&#8217;s request
I took out a fresh cigar and spent some time
over lighting it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have quite a stage instinct, monsieur, in
pausing thus at the critical moment. If I did not
know you, I might be tempted to think you were
arranging the duly dramatic unfolding of the tale,
or perhaps,&#8221; he added lightly, &#8220;considering what part
of it you need not tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is after all only the story of a failure, Prince,
and naturally one does not care to dwell too long
upon it. I went to Boreski, as you know, led him
to believe that I was the Emperor, laid before him
the papers as we arranged, and he took the objection
I had anticipated&mdash;that he must have the money in
cash instead of a draft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told him the reason&mdash;that the money was
a dowry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, and he immediately checkmated me by
saying he was already married to the Duchess and
that the consent to the marriage must be dated back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a daring fellow. It was a tight corner.
What did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t alter the date, of course, for the reason
that I could not write in the same hand, so I put up
what we Americans term a bluff,&#8221; and I described
to him what had passed, withholding, of course, all
mention of Helga and her part in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very clever, M. Denver. And why did
you not come away?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>&#8220;If I had come the papers would have been placed
in the hands of the Powers&#8217; representatives at once.
I stayed, therefore, in the hope of finding the means
to avert such a catastrophe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was almost reckless, but under the circumstances
no more than I should have expected.&#8221; He
was a fiend at the game of implied suggestion, and
again I was convinced he had secret information of
some kind. &#8220;But in the end you found you could
do nothing?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They made you a
prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did he use that plural? What &#8220;they&#8221; had
he in his mind?</p>

<p>&#8220;A prisoner in effect, because, if I left, Boreski
meant to use the papers at once. But I could have
left at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ingenious, highly ingenious. And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there was nearly the devil to pay. By some
means or other the Nihilist brotherhood got wind
of the fact that I was at Boreski&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Boreski&#8217;s?&#8221; he shot in, as if in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presumably it was Boreski&#8217;s house, and a hurried
flight followed with the object of saving me from
them, but it was ineffectual. They found me, and
an attempt was made upon my life by a man named
Vastic, and I only averted it by shooting him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What infernal villainy! It shows, of course, that
Boreski is in league with this brotherhood. And
where was this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find my way to the place, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be at Brabinsk, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>How the devil did he know that?</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a very close shave, I assure you,&#8221; I said,
trying to conceal my surprise. &#8220;It was Brabinsk;
I remember to have heard the name. How did you
know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through my agents. As a matter of fact, an
anonymous communication has been laid in the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
to the effect that murder was done there last night&mdash;the
murder of this man, Vastic.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt my nerves chill at this, with sudden dread
for Helga. He noticed the change instantly. Nothing
seemed to escape those piercing eyes of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;The facts are as I have told you. His revolver
was at my head when I got the drop on him and
fired. It was his life or mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. I don&#8217;t think you need bother your
head about the matter. My men are out there by
this time, and we know how to deal with such cases.
Vastic was one of the few really dangerous men in
this brotherhood, and by killing him you have added
to our obligation. We shall try to avoid any fuss.
By the way, were there any witnesses?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was the devil with these quietly-put, probing,
torturing questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the account they gave of it? A second
man was joined in the attempt and witnessed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the obvious parry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally nothing was said of that,&#8221; he answered
with a laugh. &#8220;I mean, was Boreski present? You
see, it would be most valuable to be able to connect
him with it, and his presence would be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Boreski was not in the house,&#8221; I answered,
cursing him in my thoughts for torture he inflicted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you stay there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you&mdash;because of the threat to use
the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course. It is a pity. I should like
to have had that link in the chain against him.&#8221; He
frowned as if genuinely concerned, and added after
a pause, &#8220;Of course, you will see the desirability&mdash;the
necessity, in fact&mdash;of telling everything, everything
in the fullest sense, I mean, in such a case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I have not?&#8221; I retorted sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the papers now?&#8221; he asked, putting
my implied repudiation on one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think we had better ask M. Boreski,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
answered, attempting a light tone and forcing a smile.
But it was an effort. I recognized that, and recognized
too that I was afraid of him. Not for myself, he could
not harm me; but terribly afraid for Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought that, too,&#8221; he answered,
copying my light tone. &#8220;But it&#8217;s just there I am
puzzled. You see, Boreski says he doesn&#8217;t know
either.&#8221; He spoke for all the world as though we
were just talking over the thing in full mutual
confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s scarcely likely, is it, that he would tell
everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, of course not. But he declares, or at
least the Duchess Stephanie does, and it&#8217;s the same
thing, that he hasn&#8217;t them.&#8221; Then he started as if
an idea had occurred to him. &#8220;By the way, you
haven&#8217;t said anything about this mysterious lady,
Mademoiselle Helga Boreski? Didn&#8217;t you think it
worth while, or didn&#8217;t you see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were on my face, and he saw the wince I
gave at the sudden thrust. He had known about
her all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t wish to bring her name into the affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur, that was a mistake. May I ask
the motive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. She is the lady whom I hope to make
my wife.&#8221; It was my turn to surprise him now,
and a long pause followed, while he sat smoking and
thinking over the new turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, M. Denver, I am genuinely sorry for you;
sorry that I ever sent you on this business. You
cannot save this lady, and it would of course be idle
for me to pretend that I do not see how your feeling
for her has actuated you. She is a Nihilist; she
has had chief part in this plot; she holds these papers;
she was present when the attempt was made on your
life&mdash;and probably instigated it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she did not,&#8221; I interposed angrily. &#8220;At that
time she knew quite well I was not the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>&#8220;So you told them that?&#8221; he returned in his quiet
suggestive manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did my utmost to obtain the papers,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are getting at cross purposes, monsieur,&#8221; he
answered with dryness. &#8220;I will not question you about
her. Probably you know who she is and what her
motive is in the strange course she is taking. I do
not yet; I am speaking frankly&mdash;more frankly than
you dealt with me&mdash;but I have now certain information,
and shall soon have more. But already I know
enough to warrant me in ordering her arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen the Duchess Stephanie this
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and shall see her again&mdash;and others. You
must face the facts, monsieur; and the facts are that
this Mademoiselle Helga will not be long at liberty,
and that any thought of marriage between you is
absolutely out of the question. She will go to the
mines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, your Highness, she will be my
wife,&#8221; I said firmly. Now that the mischief was out,
and I was no longer clogged by the need to hide
things, my embarrassment was at an end, and I recovered
my self-possession. There was a prospect of
a fight too, and my spirits rose to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see, monsieur. I am, as I say, deeply
sorry for you; but, believe me, you will not improve
your case if you attempt to espouse this reckless young
woman&#8217;s cause and fight our Government for her
sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight you, you mean, Prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a member of that Government, yes: in a
way it is fighting me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget the Emperor is my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not the friend of desperate young women
Nihilists, monsieur,&#8221; he answered with calculated
deliberateness. &#8220;You must give her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will never do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the consequences will be disastrous. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
now,&#8221; and he waved his hand as if putting that matter
aside, &#8220;there is another matter. Your killing of this
man, Vastic, has made you many enemies. Your
name is known to them as well as your appearance,
and your life may be in danger at their hands. You
were mentioned by name in the charge which reached
us. We shall of course protect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can protect myself, thank you,&#8221; I interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can run no risks of any trouble with the American
Embassy on your account, and we must therefore
charge ourselves with the task of protecting you.
What I propose to you, therefore, is, as I said at first,
that you either return to the frontier, or that you start
on your journey to Khiva under strong escort, and
that you adopt one of those courses forthwith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank your Highness, but I shall not go. I
shall not leave Petersburg, at any rate until I have
seen the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose then and tossed away his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hold you for a man of decision, monsieur, but
in this case I will give you an opportunity of reconsidering
this one. I will see you again in an
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not find me here. I shall go to an hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For that hour at least it will not be convenient
to us for you to take such a step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does your Highness make me a prisoner?&#8221; I
demanded indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see you again in an hour, monsieur,&#8221; he
replied, and with that left the room, without heeding
my angry retort.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone the servant entered and
asked my permission to attend to the rooms. I gave
it to him, and throwing such things as lay to hand
into a grip I went to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not be back,&#8221; I said to him, and he turned
and looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, monsieur,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But I believe
His Highness wishes to see you here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>I flung the door open, for my temper was up, and
then found I was indeed a prisoner. Three men were
posted there on guard.</p>

<p>Affecting to believe their presence had nothing to
do with me, I made as if to brush by them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, monsieur,&#8221; said the man in command,
&#8220;but my orders are to desire you to be so
good as to await His Highness&#8217;s return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told the Prince I will see him another time,&#8221;
I returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deepest regrets, monsieur; but my orders were
very precise;&#8221; and as it was quite evident that he
was prepared to prevent my departure by force if
necessary, I gave in, went back into the room and
slammed the door. Just one of those childish acts
a man commits in a rage.</p>

<p>But the situation was far too grave for my vexation
over the mere personal indignity to last long.
The thing had to be considered as an indication of
the length to which the Prince was ready to go
in the absence of the Emperor. He would stick at
nothing; and the treachery which had destroyed
Helga&#8217;s father years ago was still a practical policy
with him.</p>

<p>The question was what he could do to me and
whether he would attempt to keep me from seeing
the Emperor. It was clear that his suspicions had
fastened upon Helga. He had had his own reasons
for asking so pointedly about her real motives.</p>

<p>&#8220;You probably know who she is; I do not&mdash;yet,&#8221;
he had said; but he had a connecting link almost
in his hands in the person of Boreski. Moreover he
had accepted my news as meaning that I should
associate myself with her. If then he guessed that
she was so dangerous to him as the daughter of the
dead Lavalski would be, I could not doubt he would
strain every nerve, not only to secure her and put
her away as a Nihilist, but also to keep me as her
champion from getting to the Emperor&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>But what should I do? That was the question.
Drive me out of Russia he should not; that I was
resolved; but shut up in my room in the Palace I
was as powerless as if I had been in New York. He
could set his dogs to hunt down Helga and have her
half-way to Siberia before I might get a chance to
escape; and the thought was almost maddening in
my then state of mind.</p>

<p>Presently it occurred to me to try and meet craft
with craft, to pretend to accept his offer of a safe
conduct to the frontier and then return. To get out
of the Palace by way of the frontier was a long route,
but it was better than remaining where I was, and
things being as they were it appeared the only course
for me to adopt.</p>

<p>It was nearly three hours, instead of only one,
before he returned, and when he came I saw that
he had fresh news. I could read him sufficiently
well by this time to see that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret the delay, M. Denver, but it has been
unavoidable,&#8221; he said in suave apology. &#8220;Have you
considered your decision?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I protest in the strongest manner, Prince Kalkov,
against my forcible detention here. I demand, as
a citizen of the United States, to have an opportunity
of communicating with our Embassy here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That course is open to you naturally, and if you
press it I cannot and shall not oppose it. You may
indeed find it necessary&mdash;in your own defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am free to go to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly that, but you will have the usual
opportunities,&#8221; he answered with one of his infernal
implied threats.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by usual opportunities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our legal procedure in regard to foreigners is
not perhaps very swift, but it is very just; and if
you prefer an open investigation into this man Vastic&#8217;s
death to the course I indicated before, I cannot of
course object. And as an American accused of murder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
you would be fully entitled to all the help of the
American embassy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know the truth as to that,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;And personally have not a doubt that your act
was committed in self-defence. Still it <i>was</i> committed,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He finished with a shrug of the shoulders
and a lifting of the hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you accuse me of murder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? God forbid I should do you such an injustice,&#8221;
he said, as if in indignant repudiation of the idea.
&#8220;It is others who do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the devil, Prince Kalkov,&#8221; I cried
furiously. &#8220;This is just another of your infernal
schemes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that quite just to me, when I have offered you
a safe conduct across the frontier, or to anywhere
you please? It is you who place me in this awkward
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with your hypocrisy,&#8221; I exclaimed, losing
my head in my rage. &#8220;Speak out bluntly, and say
what you do mean&mdash;that if I won&#8217;t consent to leave
the country you will take this devil&#8217;s way of getting
me into one of your cursed prisons while you carry
out your other plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, M. Denver, this language to me is beyond
bounds&mdash;even for a free-speaking citizen of the
United States. It is true we might not be able to
get the proceedings finished for some weeks; I have
known it take months, indeed. There was the case
of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil take your cases. Do your worst, and
we&#8217;ll fight it out on those lines;&#8221; and I turned away
and flung myself into a chair.</p>

<p>But he was my match at that tactic also. He sat
down, drew a small table to his side, took out some
papers and studied them with slow methodical deliberation.
He calculated that my temper would not
last, and that I should then see the utter futility of
resisting him. And of course it proved so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll accept your terms and leave Russia,&#8221; I said,
when the silence had lasted many minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he said, as if he was buried in some
other matters. &#8220;Just one minute,&#8221; and he went on
with his papers, and then folded them up neatly.
&#8220;Now I am at your service again. Let us talk it
over. Why do you treat me as an enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather not discuss anything except my
departure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please, but the matter is not quite where
it was when we last spoke of it. I know a great deal
more than I did, and I am compelled to regard you
as more dangerous than before. You are at liberty
to leave, but I shall have to ask you for a written
declaration on your word of honour as an American
gentleman that you will go straight to America, and
that you will make no effort to communicate, directly
or indirectly, with my August Master. Further, I
shall place at your disposal a courier, who will accompany
you to the port you select&mdash;I would suggest
Hamburg&mdash;and attend on you until you reach New
York. This I do partly for your personal safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And chiefly as a spy to see that I do go, you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will of course report to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I refuse?&#8221; I asked, when I could force
myself to speak without anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will not refuse, because if you are
still in Russia when the man Vastic&#8217;s death is investigated&mdash;and
time in that matter presses, of course&mdash;it
will be very difficult, I fear, to avoid your being
implicated.&#8221; The perfect command he had over his
expression and tone aggravated me almost as much
as what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make a condition on my side&mdash;that
Mademoiselle Helga Boreski be allowed to leave the
country at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Helga Lavalski, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nearly broke my teeth as I clenched them at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said whom I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>&#8220;Well, there are two objections. You know her
story of course, and so do I&mdash;<i>now</i>. She is, as you
are aware, unwilling to leave until she has ruined me
for some fancied wrong; and she is a dangerous
Nihilist, with whom the authorities can have no dealings
except in the usual legal way. She will go to
the mines, as I told you, if we deal with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you have found her, perhaps,&#8221; I cried with
a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;True; and true also that we may not have to
deal with her at all. She has, as you know, incurred
the vengeance of this brotherhood, and it may be
less troublesome to leave her to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, she is as safe from them as from
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not more so. You left a paper in your
coat which the servant found and handed to me.
You had scribbled on it two or three words which
I thought might have reference to her&mdash;about a small
red-brick house in the north-east corner of the Square
of San Sophia. I followed up that clue, and by this
time the information we gained is in the hands of the
brotherhood. They will know how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, for God&#8217;s sake, stop,&#8221; I said hoarsely,
jumping to my feet in horror. &#8220;I can bear no more.
If you say another word, I swear to God I shall find
it in me to kill you where you sit.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Prince had nerves of steel, and met my
threatening look with a calm and steady gaze,
absolutely unmoved by my passionate outbreak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better calm yourself, M. Denver. It will
not help the case of an accused murderer to attempt
my life, and such an attempt must fail, as a single cry
from me will bring in the men at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the room then,&#8221; I cried bluntly, &#8220;lest
the passion to choke the life out of you passes control.&#8221;
I flung myself back in my chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could realize that I am indeed grieved
for you. Your violence now shows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with your sympathy,&#8221; I said brutally. &#8220;It
is all a lie, like the rest of you. Do what you please
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the insult, as he did everything from me,
unmoved, save for a shrug of the shoulders, and for
a minute was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot save this woman. Will you leave
Russia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you spare her if I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pretended to think for a space.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I will not,&#8221; he said implacably. &#8220;She has
sown the seed and must reap the crop. That is the
law of intrigue such as hers. Moreover,&#8221; he added as
he glanced at his watch, &#8220;it is probably already too
late for me or you either to save her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no jot of humanity in you? Are you
utterly cold, calculating and brutal? You could send
her warning.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>&#8220;It is possible nothing may be done until to-night.
But it is no part of my duty to warn a Nihilist who
betrays her comrades.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russian chivalry is a noble thing,&#8221; I sneered.
&#8220;But, by God, remember this,&#8221; I added fiercely, leaning
forward, &#8220;if harm comes to her, you shall pay
for it with your life, if I come from the other side of
the earth to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been threatened many times, M. Denver,
by men as desperate as yourself&mdash;and still live. But
now,&#8221; he asked as he rose, &#8220;will you leave Russia, or
do you compel me to order your arrest on this murder
charge? You are young, with a bright future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind my future,&#8221; I put in. &#8220;Do what you
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your violence to me will be added to the charge
now, and our influence with our judges is great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, before there&#8217;s another death to be added also.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the door and turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am still very reluctant, for you tried to serve
us. Take another day to think, and give me your
word of honour to make no attempt to escape. You
can then stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; I cried, turning my back on him, and I did
not look round until he had left the room.</p>

<p>Desperate as my own plight was, my thoughts were
not for myself, but for Helga. I cursed myself a thousand
times for my insensate blundering stupidity which
had brought all this danger upon her, the very blunder
against which she herself had warned me.</p>

<p>I remembered scribbling the words in the carriage,
and saw now that instead of tearing up the paper on
which I had written I must have torn up the blank
sheet. I recalled that when she had warned me not
to throw even the fragments in one place, I had found
none but blanks in my fingers, and I could have torn
my hair out to think I had been such a reckless idiot
as not to search my pocket again to make sure.</p>

<p>I had destroyed her. I who would have given my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
life to save her; and that bitter hour of miserable unavailing
remorse held horrors for me no description
can convey. It will never pass from memory, and I
marvel that in my agony I did not go insane.</p>

<p>I was far past caring what happened to me, and
when the door opened and I looked up expecting to
see the police with the warrant for me, I was ready
to welcome this arrest as a distraction from my
thoughts. Anything, anything to get away from the
maddening oppressiveness of my gloom.</p>

<p>It was not the police, however, but the servant who
brought me food.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bring that here,&#8221; I cried, when the man set
it down.</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in great trouble, monsieur,&#8221; he said, not
unkindly. &#8220;But one must eat, even in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to God I was dead,&#8221; I exclaimed desperately;
&#8220;and you talk of eating. Take it away, man,
take it away, or I shall do you a mischief,&#8221; and I
turned to the window and leaned my fevered head
against the sash.</p>

<p>Helga was being pursued by these sleuth hounds
and would be killed&mdash;killed for having tried to save
my life&mdash;and it was I&mdash;I who had laid them upon
her trail and brought destruction upon her. Already
they might have struck the blow. And I could barely
keep myself from moaning aloud in my impotent
anguish.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I started. I had made a discovery.</p>

<p>A man came into sight in the ground below. It
was one of the gardeners, and he crossed from the
right until an abutment of the Palace hid him from
my view on the left.</p>

<p>I was only two storeys from the ground, and the
roof of the out-building behind which the man had
been lost to sight could probably be reached from my
bedroom window. Then by a curious memory freak
an old joke dashed into my thoughts, and I smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
It was the story of the man who languished in gaol
for twenty years racking his brains with elaborate
plans for escape, and then&mdash;opened the door and
walked out.</p>

<p>My God, the way of escape lay right here. I might
still get to Helga. I had to steady myself against the
window frame now in the rush of this new excitement.</p>

<p>I turned back to the servant. He was still there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take those things away when I
tell you,&#8221; I said, trying to speak in my former tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will try to eat, monsieur. You have
fasted long.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was conscious suddenly of hunger. I might have
work to do for Helga, and must keep up my strength.
My new thoughts had changed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long is it since I breakfasted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many hours, monsieur. It is now nearly five
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five o&#8217;clock. How the time had flown! My interviews
with Kalkov, and the intervals, had eaten up
the day. Five o&#8217;clock! I groaned. The dusk would
soon fall, and if Helga were not already in the hands
of her enemies, the time in which a warning could
reach her might almost be counted by minutes.</p>

<p>I must get rid of the servant, and perhaps if I ate
the food he had brought it would save time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take your advice.&#8221; I sat down to the table
and ate with the speed which only Americans have
cultivated as a fine art. In a few minutes I had swallowed
almost everything he had brought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad, monsieur. You were then hungry after
all,&#8221; he said with a deferential air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have finished. You can take it away,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>I lit a cigar and watched him as he piled the things
on the trays. He was very slow and methodical, and
I fretted and fumed over the time he took, until I felt
I could have kicked him out of the room and thrown
the trays after him. Then he showed an inclination to
talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>&#8220;You are an American, I think, monsieur,&#8221; he said,
playing at rearranging the things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a fine country, I believe, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a brother there. He is doing well. He is
in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to earn very large sums of money
there, monsieur. He is married and has a business
of his own. He sells birds and animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; Would he never stop his gabbling and get
away?</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He wishes me to go to him. I think I shall
some day. But there is the sea to cross, and I have
never seen it. You have crossed the sea, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I should not like his trade, monsieur. I am
fond of birds and animals&mdash;but not in cages; oh no,
not in cages. It is like imprisonment, is it not, monsieur?
And here in Russia one does not speak lightly
of prisons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; I gave him nothing but monosyllables, but
his chatter seemed to thrive on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I should not like his trade,&#8221; and he shook his
head dolefully. &#8220;I have a heart, monsieur, and if I
went there I think I should ruin him. I should want
to let the birds out of their cages, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>A new interest in him and his chatter sprang to life
in my thoughts. I looked up sharply, and caught his
eyes fixed on me with an inscrutable expression in
them. Did he mean anything by the words?</p>

<p>&#8220;A kind heart is a good thing,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur, but&#8221;&mdash;he sighed&mdash;&#8220;it is sometimes
liable to get one into trouble.&#8221; He had finished
now with even his pretence of packing the things together,
and he paused and said, &#8220;You are a prisoner,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>&#8220;It is very sad, monsieur. Well, I will have these
things taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take them away yourself,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, monsieur, but my orders are not
to leave the room again. I am to stay with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And my heart sank as he touched the bell, and we
waited, in silence until the trays had been fetched.
Then he stood close to the doorway between the two
rooms.</p>

<p>It began to look as if there would be a tussle of
strength before I got away, and I measured him in
my eye with this thought present to me. He was
a slightly built wiry little man, no sort of a match for
me if it came to a trial of strength; but I preferred
another way if it could be managed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall I remain, monsieur?&#8221; he asked after
a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it you who ransacked my pockets this morning?&#8221;
I asked, recalling Kalkov&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Prince&#8217;s orders, monsieur. We all fear
him&mdash;but we all hate him. We dare not disobey
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether he meant me to understand anything by
this or not I could not tell, but the time was pressing
so fast that my anxiety drove me to bring matters
to a crisis, and soon I had a plan. Any moment might
now find me in the hands of the police.</p>

<p>I got up and passed into the bedroom, my purpose
being to catch him suddenly at a disadvantage, fling
him on to the bed, and smother his cries with the pillows
while I tied him up and gagged him.</p>

<p>He seemed suspicious of my intentions, for he hung
back, but one is always tempted to suppose that others
may divine such thoughts. So I fooled around with
some of my clothes, and then called him to help me
move a bag. I got him near enough to the bedstead,
and then with a significant look I said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a good heart, I can see that. Now, assuming
I am like one of your brother&#8217;s caged birds,
will you help me out?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>&#8220;Monsieur, I dare not, I dare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he neither called out nor attempted to get away.
Instead, he fixed his eyes on mine, and there was no
fear in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make it worth your while,&#8221; I said firmly.
&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, monsieur, if it were found out. I am sorry
for you; but if it were found out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be. We&#8217;ll fix that all right,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Listen. I intend to escape by the window there,
drop on the roof below, and from there to the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, monsieur, monsieur, I dare not,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall give you five hundred roubles to help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed avariciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will help you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but you must make
it seem that you have forced me. You must bind me
and stop my mouth, so that when they come and find
me they shall see you have forced me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a very thin device, but if it satisfied him I
had no reason to care, especially as I had contemplated
doing it in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you must not go yet, monsieur, not until dark.
You would be seen; the grounds are alive with guards
and soldiers. You must wait till seven o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why till seven o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be dark enough before; and besides, a
number of men go away at that hour&mdash;the gardeners&mdash;and
I can tell you how to get out so that no one
will see you if you wait till then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well, but I may be arrested first,&#8221;
I said suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No no, monsieur. You are to stay here all night.
I heard his highness say so, and I was told to remain
here until ten o&#8217;clock, when I am to be relieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was Helga to think of, however, and to remain
there an hour and a half longer while she was in
momentary peril seemed intolerable. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
time, there was wisdom in what the man said. To
get out of the grounds in daylight, while the gardeners
and others were about, was just a forlorn hope, and
bitterly as I chafed at the delay, I resolved to wait
until dusk came.</p>

<p>That hour and a half was the longest in my life.
The man did his best to occupy my thoughts, telling
me over and over again exactly the way I had to go
so as to avoid meeting any one, pointing out part of it
from the window, and giving me a hundred hints and
suggestions.</p>

<p>As the time approached I gave him the sum I had
promised, stowed the rest of the money about me, and
then fastened him up. He himself suggested an ingenious
method. I wrapped a sheet round him, and
then wound certain cords about him, until he looked
like a mummy in clean clothes, and could move neither
hand nor foot; and then I fastened a pillow over his
head.</p>

<p>Bearing all he had said in mind, I opened the
window, got down on to the roof below, crept along
it, and finding the coast clear, dropped to the ground.
I fell on to a flower bed, and darted at full speed
across the lawn to the point he had told me.</p>

<p>He had earned his money well, for I was able to
follow his instructions to the letter with the greatest
ease. He had told me to make for that part of the
gardens where the greenhouses stood, and past them
to take a path to the left until I came to a spot where
an out-house with a low sloping roof stood against the
high outside wall. By means of this I was to climb
to the top of the wall, and then drop into a dark unfrequented
road. I was to go along this to the right
for about half a mile, when I should find myself at a
point from which I could easily reach any part of the
city.</p>

<p>I remember being struck by the fact that a part
of the Palace grounds so near to the building should
be so deserted, but I had not a thought or suspicion
of treachery of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>I reached the road within a very short time of
leaving the room, and turning, as he had told me, to
the right, I ran along it at a sharp speed. It was
overhung with heavy trees and very dark, but on this
fact I congratulated myself as I ran.</p>

<p>I had covered half the distance when the path narrowed
between the high wall of the Palace grounds
on one side and an equally high hedge on the other,
and it was so dark that I could not see the ground
beneath me. I was so keen to get to Helga that I
pressed on at headlong speed, until my foot slipped
on something wet and greasy and down I went all
a-sprawl in the dirt.</p>

<p>My hat flew off and my head struck the ground,
and my face slid along in the mud, but beyond grazing
my skin and griming myself considerably, I
suffered no hurt. I fell on the soft mud and thus
made scarcely any noise, a fact to which I believe I
owed my life.</p>

<p>I sat up, and was groping about for my hat when
I heard a sound some way ahead of me. Thinking
some one was coming I rolled under the shadow of
the great hedge and waited.</p>

<p>I have said before that my sense of hearing is very
acute, but though I strained it now to the utmost I
heard nothing for some time. In the meanwhile I
found that in the dark I had blundered into a kind
of broad ditch which crossed the path, the bottom
being of soft wet mire.</p>

<p>I pulled myself cautiously up on to the dry ground,
and putting my ear to the earth lay as still as death
and listened.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the sound of the shuffling of feet,
and as it was repeated after a few moments&#8217; interval,
I could tell some one was waiting at a distance ahead
of me.</p>

<p>I must find out what it meant, and that at once,
for minutes were precious. I sat up, therefore, and
took off my boots, and as I was rising my hand struck
against my hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>I crept forward now as cautiously as before I had
ran heedlessly, stopping every few yards to listen.</p>

<p>That any one could be waiting for me did not even
then cross my mind; but I was carrying too great a
responsibility to run risks and although the slow
progress I made chafed and worried me, I dared not
quicken it. And well it was indeed that I exercised
this restraint.</p>

<p>There was very little wind moving, but what there
was came from the direction I was going, and in one
of the pauses I made to listen, I caught the sound of
a voice, and then heard the tread of heavy feet. In
a moment I rolled myself under the hedge.</p>

<p>The steps came nearer, and I could tell there were
two men. They were speaking in low guttural tones,
but I could not at first catch the words, until one
of them said in a louder voice, with a touch of
impatience&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, seven o&#8217;clock, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a flash my eyes were open. It was the hour the
servant had insisted upon for my escape. The whole
thing had been planned by Kalkov himself. And these
men were&mdash;who?</p>

<p>I was not long in doubt on that point either.</p>

<p>The two came on, drew level, and passed; and as
I held my breath I heard a muttered reference to the
brotherhood and Vastic&#8217;s murder, which told me all
I needed to know.</p>

<p>The Prince had adopted the same policy toward
me as toward Helga, and having planned the means
of my escape through that treacherous scoundrel of
a servant, had managed to convey to the brotherhood
an intimation of where and when I could be found.</p>

<p>But for that fall of mine into the mud the plan
would have succeeded, and there would have been
an end of any interference from me in his plans.</p>

<p>I had no time to waste in cursing him, however;
and as soon as the men were well past I rolled out
from the hedge and crept on as quickly as I could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>I was afraid there would be a third man to be dealt
with at the mouth of the place, but to my infinite relief
the coast was clear, and putting on my boots again
I turned into the road and walked briskly in the direction
of the city.</p>

<p>I was in a deplorable mess from my tumble, and
tried with very little effect to get rid of some of the
mud from my clothes and face.</p>

<p>It was while I was doing this, and puzzling how
I should get admission to Helga&#8217;s house that the need
for some disguise occurred to me. I should probably
have to pass some of the brotherhood spies near the
house, and if I were recognized the consequences
might be vitally serious.</p>

<p>The means for the disguise were in fact supplied
by the mud into which I had fallen. I knocked in the
crown of my hat, took off my coat, tore my shirt-sleeves
half-way to the elbows, daubed them and my arms and
hands with mud, and in a minute was changed into a
dirty disreputable loafer, whom any one would have
the greatest difficulty in recognizing as Harper C.
Denver, the smartly groomed New Yorker.</p>

<p>And in this guise I hurried as fast as I dared without
exciting suspicion from the police in the direction
of the square of San Sophia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXI</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">AT THE SQUARE OF
SAN SOPHIA</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM Czar to street smouch was a big change of
parts, and had I had time to think and opportunity
to choose, I would have selected a different
character.</p>

<p>But I had little conscious thought beyond a burning
impatience to get to Helga in the shortest possible
time. I was jostled and pushed as I hurried on; now
hustled off the side walk, now grazing the house fronts,
and at times dodging through the traffic: but all the
while pressing on with feverish haste through the
people, followed constantly by curses and angry threats
from those who shrank from my dirty presence or
shouldered me roughly to one side.</p>

<p>There is no lack of disreputable-looking beggars
in the streets of Russia&#8217;s capital at any time, and at
night one drunken man more or less attracts little attention,
provided he keeps quiet. I was taken for a
drunkard; and my dirt-begrimed face and clothes,
my coat slung over my shoulder, my half-bared arms
and muddied shirt-sleeves lent colour to the part, as I
scrambled and scurried along with a wary eye for the
police, whom I avoided with scrupulous care.</p>

<p>I had not much difficulty in finding the square of
San Sophia, which had once been a fashionable quarter.
It was a dismal-looking <i>cul de sac</i>, with a winding
entrance at the southern end, in shape like nothing so
much as a tennis racket with a bent handle.</p>

<p>At the entrance stood a woman, who came toward
me, half paused, stared sharply at me, and passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
on. I guessed she was a spy of some kind, posted
there to mark all who entered and left the square.</p>

<p>I lurched past her, keeping up my part of a drunken
man, and reeled on into the square&mdash;a small open
space, unrailed and unprotected, with two or three
forlorn-looking stunted trees in a clump in the centre.</p>

<p>From the shelter of these I was able to make out
Helga&#8217;s house&mdash;standing well back in the shadow&mdash;a
wider, shorter building than the rest, with a deep
porch. Not a light showed in any of the windows,
a fact that gave me a momentary qualm.</p>

<p>Having assured myself that no one was watching
me, I stole out from the trees and made for the porch,
knocked gently at the door, and waited. No one came,
and fearing to give any noisy summons, I was feeling
and peering about for a bell&mdash;for inside the porch
was very dark&mdash;when I heard footsteps in the square.
By the flickering lamplight at the entrance I saw the
woman who had met me returning in company with a
man, and, to my dismay, they came with rapid steps
toward the spot where I stood.</p>

<p>I lay down and squeezed myself as close to the side
of the porch as possible, trusting that the gloom of
the place would prevent them seeing me.</p>

<p>The footsteps came right to the house and then
stopped.</p>

<p>In a fever of impatience I dragged myself cautiously
to the entrance and peering out, watched them.</p>

<p>They stood a moment talking together in whispers
at the other end of the house. The woman seemed to
be giving the man some information and instructions,
for I saw her point several times toward that end of
the building.</p>

<p>After perhaps a couple of minutes she left, and
the man shrank back into the deep shadows, until the
sound of her footsteps had ceased. Then I heard the
scrape of his feet against brickwork, and could just
make out that he had climbed on to a low wall which
ran by the side of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>At the risk of discovery I felt that I must know
where he had gone, so I drew off my boots and stole
after him. By the side of the house ran a very narrow
passage guarded by a heavy iron gate, and crawling
on to the wall I followed the man with as much
haste as the need for extreme caution permitted.</p>

<p>The house was as still as a charnel vault; but I
was no longer dismayed by this. It was evident that
such a visitor must have very strong motives for this
kind of secrecy; and as I judged that the woman had
pointed out the means by which an entrance to the
house could be gained, it was easy to understand that
this was all connected with the threatened attack upon
Helga. This meant therefore that she was still safe,
and that I had arrived in time to take a hand in
matters.</p>

<p>When I had gone far enough along the wall to get
a view of the rear of the house, I lay down and looked
about for the man, and soon discovered his plan. There
were no underground rooms to the house, but there
were cellars, and the way to these was protected by a
heavy grating. He had removed this, and when I
caught sight of him he was standing below in the act
of replacing this grating above his head.</p>

<p>As soon as it was in its place, I slipped off the wall
and listened. He entered the cellar, and when once
inside struck a match, the feeble flickering light from
which enabled me to watch him.</p>

<p>He looked round for a moment as if in doubt, and
then went to a door in the far right-hand corner and
knocked: three double knocks, repeated at short intervals.
After a while I heard the door open; the
sound of muffled gruff voices came to me; the door
was closed, and then all was silent as the grave once
more.</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated whether to follow him
or to go back to the front and try again to get into
the house that way. But my former failure to attract
attention there decided me against that course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>It was just possible that Helga had arranged these
precautions in the critical need to conceal her presence
in the house, and in that case, if I once gained admittance,
I could easily explain my presence. But it
seemed far more probable that a very ugly purpose
lay under it all, and this I resolved to ascertain, even
at the risk of finding myself face to face with one or
two members of the brotherhood.</p>

<p>I slipped on my boots and coat, therefore, and following
the man&#8217;s example, I got through the grating,
and finding the inner door, gave the signal I had
heard. It was an anxious moment as I huddled up
against the door awaiting the result. It was a long
wait, until I heard a stealthy movement; the door
was opened slowly and cautiously, and a man, holding
a light, looked out.</p>

<p>Not caring for any scrutiny of my face, I put my
foot in the crack and my shoulder to the door, and
shoved my way in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why keep me waiting?&#8221; I asked in a whisper.
&#8220;I am followed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;One who should be here,&#8221; I answered at random,
as I closed the door and shot home the bolt. &#8220;Lead
the way,&#8221; I said, in a tone of authority.</p>

<p>He was for thrusting the light in my face, but I
brushed his hand away and growled out an oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is here?&#8221; I asked then, under my breath.</p>

<p>He made no reply, and seemed quite undecided
what to do; so I decided for him, and pushed him
very unceremoniously before me into the darkness
beyond.</p>

<p>He led me into an inner cellar, unlighted, save for
the candle he carried. I followed, prepared for almost
anything except that which I saw; and seeing it, I
could scarce restrain from laughter, so complete was
the relief from the tension of the previous few
minutes.</p>

<p>There was only one man there&mdash;obviously the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
same I had followed&mdash;and he was staring hard at
us with an expression of mingled fear and expectation.
It was Paul Drexel. He was shaved, and disguised
in the shabby clothes of a beggar; but I knew
his flabby coward&#8217;s face in a moment, although he did
not recognize me. And I took care that he should see
my face as little as possible. For an instant the question
flashed upon me: What Drexel was doing in the
affair? But I had to act, not think, because if my
supposition was correct, we should soon have more
of the men upon us.</p>

<p>There was no longer any reason for fear. With
no one but a fat coward like Drexel and the man
with the light to oppose me, I should soon find a way
out of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked Drexel, as I entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here to take command,&#8221; I replied, muffling
my voice. I turned to the other man and asked:
&#8220;What part of the house are we in? How do we
get where we have to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the cellars. They didn&#8217;t think of them,&#8221;
he replied, with a grin of cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me,&#8221; and I made him light the way for me.</p>

<p>My examination of the place revealed nothing but
bare cellars.</p>

<p>My guide pointed out a flight of stairs, and explained
that there was only a door at the top, which
would not be difficult to force.</p>

<p>My first step was to get rid of him; and as he was
now quite unsuspicious of me, this was easy.</p>

<p>I found that one of the cellars had a door with bolts
on the outside, and as we stood in it, I made an excuse
to take the light from him, and catching him
unawares, I gave him a blow on the side of the head
which sent him staggering over the floor, and before
he could recover himself I had shut the door and
bolted it upon him.</p>

<p>He began a clatter at the door, and I called to
Drexel sharply&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>&#8220;Come and help here, quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came hurrying out, but before he could ask a
question I caught him by the throat and shook out
of him all his little courage and most of his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up these steps, quick,&#8221; I said, dragging him up,
and reaching the top I hammered and kicked at the
door until some one came.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the devil&#8217;s name what&#8217;s this?&#8221; cried a voice
threateningly, as the door was opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God it&#8217;s you, Ivan,&#8221; I said, more glad
than I can tell to see him. &#8220;The mademoiselle; is
she safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver!&#8221; he exclaimed, in profound astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Helga, man, tell me, is all well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur, but what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that,&#8221; I interrupted, the sense of
relief filling me with indescribable delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you come here, monsieur?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;And who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused to peer into Drexel&#8217;s
white face. &#8220;M. Drexel, Great Lord of the Skies,
what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga was safe, and for me at that moment the
whole world held no other matter of concern. But
there was much to do, for which even the ecstasy of
that knowledge could not wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this treacherous snake, and have him kept
safe somewhere until we can question him. And
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened, Ivan?&#8221; It was Helga&#8217;s
voice from above stairs, and hearing it, I smiled and
caught my breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver is here, mademoiselle,&#8221; said Ivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver?&#8221; in a tone of intense surprise.
&#8220;Where?&#8221; The voice was nearer. She was coming
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am here, mademoiselle;&#8221; and I went to
meet her.</p>

<p>On catching sight of me she stopped as if aghast.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="allsmcap">I CAUGHT HIM BY THE THROAT AND SHOOK OUT OF HIM ALL HIS<br />
LITTLE COURAGE AND MOST OF HIS BREATH.</span>&#8221;&mdash;<a href="#Page_208"><i>Page 208.</i></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t look pretty, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; I said, with a
laugh. &#8220;But it&#8217;s about the best show I can make for
the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were now full of sweet concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in great trouble?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s the matter that a bath and a clothes
brush won&#8217;t cure. But it&#8217;s been a near thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, everything; but not now. Let me see you
presently; there is some work to be done first. You
will have to leave here; go and get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave here? I cannot. I must not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The place is known to Kalkov&#8217;s police and to
Vastic&#8217;s friends. There has been hell&#8217;s work; but
you will be safe now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew Ivan aside then and told him what I knew
and surmised, and how I proposed to act. My idea
was that he should take some of the servants down
into the cellars with him; let the men who were expected
enter one by one, seize them and make them
prisoners.</p>

<p>Ivan was the man of all men I would have chosen
for such a task. He possessed enormous strength and
a courage equal to any demands that could be made
upon it; I knew I could leave the affair safely in his
hands.</p>

<p>When I had explained my wishes and seen him
start, I went to question Drexel. He was in a condition
of abject terror, and was to me such a repulsive
creature that I hurried my examination of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you know how to speak the truth, I advise you
to do it now. I know much about you and your doings,
and if I find you lying to me I shall denounce you as a
traitor to the men you were to have met here. And
you know what to expect at their hands.&#8221; I gave him
a second to chew this, and then asked: &#8220;Now, whose
spy are you, police or these men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither. I have not come to help in this thing;
I have not on my soul: I know nothing of them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to get the papers from Mademoiselle Helga
for Prince Kalkov.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are his agent, eh? How did you get in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was told to meet a woman in the square who
would tell me what to do to get in.&#8221; This might be
true, for I had seen the two together. &#8220;I expected to
find the house deserted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you your instructions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Kalkov himself. If I refused, he threatened
me with the mines, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a Nihilist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get to the Prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>I repeated the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to clear myself,&#8221; he said slowly and with
hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;To offer yourself as a spy, you mean?&#8221; I replied
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a suspect, and I wanted to clear myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he told you you could clear yourself by getting
these papers. I think I understand you. He told
you also that mademoiselle would be assassinated, and
that you could do your present work safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my soul, no. I had no thought of that. I had
not. I was told she would be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave the information to these men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, monsieur; indeed, I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t
know who they are. I was told only police would be
here. You can kill me if you will, but that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was disposed to believe him, and to regard him
as a mere tool of Kalkov, sent to the house as being
likely to know where to look for the papers; and
in this case he knew too little to be of much help
to me.</p>

<p>It was quite consistent with Kalkov&#8217;s methods that
he should use Drexel for the purpose he had described;
and although there were discrepancies in the statement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
I did not think it worth while to waste valuable time
in interrogating him any further.</p>

<p>What we had now to think about was the vital
question of Helga&#8217;s escape, and I left the miserable
wretch, glad to be out of his presence, and went to
urge upon Helga the necessity of immediate flight.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS I hurried out from Drexel, intending to try and
find means to render myself more presentable
by getting rid of some of my grime, I found Helga
waiting for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am all mud,&#8221; I said apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am all impatience, and that is worse,&#8221; she
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me get rid of some of this;&#8221; and I spread
out my hands and glanced down at my clothes, and
looked up to find her smiling. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell how
glad I am to see that,&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see no smiles if you keep me waiting.
I will forgive the dirt if you will only tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell you more comfortably if we were
<i>en route</i> for the frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we shall be soon. Come,&#8221; and she led
me into a room, all dirty as I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Disaster is easy to tell. Prince Kalkov knows
everything about your plans, your name, your real
part in Boreski&#8217;s business, your fight against him&mdash;everything;&#8221;
and as shortly as I could I told her
all I knew and had learnt from the Prince.</p>

<p>She listened with scarcely an interruption, and when
I finished sat thinking with pursed lips and gathered
brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very clever and very devilish,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;And for the time it means failure. You are right.
I must fly, and that to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had to do it before&mdash;for a time. But I
shall, of course, come back. I am not beaten. Flight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
is only one of the tactics in the fight I am waging.
I shall never cease to fight until I win or they kill
me. But he has beaten me for the time, and now that
he knows my motive, he will be harder to fight than
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I who have ruined you by betraying this
place through my stupid blundering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I had not thought of that,&#8221; she said, turning
and smiling to me. &#8220;You will have suffered. It was
a mistake, but it would have made no difference in
the end. With the new clues which the Duchess
Stephanie and this Drexel could give him, the Prince
would have found me here. I should not have waited
for him indeed, so that by warning me now you have
more than made good the mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think Boreski has told him anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not Boreski; I am sure of him. It is Drexel.
A man when he is afraid for his life is a contemptible
creature. But it is his nature,&#8221; she said scornfully.
&#8220;I knew it and knew him. I used him as a tool, and
when a tool breaks in your hand, you are fortunate
if you are not hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner we start the better.&#8221; But she was
thinking and appeared not to hear me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to begin again,&#8221; she said, with quiet
resolution. &#8220;It is no new experience. I have had
to do it two or three times before. My next attempt
shall be better planned. Each time I do better&mdash;learning
from my failures. Next time I shall win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall we start?&#8221; I asked, as she paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;We? If you are wise and take my advice, you
will go to your Ambassador, tell him frankly all that
has occurred, and get his help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I am not wise?&#8221; I sought her eyes and
we both smiled, and she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, you must not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I shall, Helga. Let us be frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish me to be frank?&#8221; and she looked up
calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I would rather you did not attempt to accompany
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to leave me in the lurch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she cried, with a little wince of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that&mdash;but you know what I do
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know nothing can come of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it nothing or something, it is just all in all
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please!&#8221; she said, almost pleadingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have no mercy when you speak of parting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I mean it. You must not come with me.
I am stronger alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be very stupid&mdash;when you wish,&#8221; she
cried, with another smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;Why stronger alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;ah, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I not wish to hear you say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up steadily, and said in a quiet, firm
tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because when you are with me I weaken in my
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just my object. I hope to win you from
it altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible. You must not go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish never to see me again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How cruel you can be!&#8221; Then defiantly, &#8220;Yes,
I do wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I cried decidedly, as I rose. &#8220;Then
I will go.&#8221; I paused, and she started and gave me
a glance in which surprise and pain were blended.
I went to the door, and turning, saw she had paled
slightly. I waited for her to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am glad.&#8221; The tone was very low, and her
lips faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have put up with it long enough. I can
bear it no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>A quick questioning, half-indignant light was in
her eyes as she rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can bear it no longer. I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh from me checked the words on her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never been so dirty in my life. I <i>must</i>
wash.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away with a toss of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You treat it as a jest&mdash;at such a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I am earnest you won&#8217;t take me seriously&mdash;you
won&#8217;t take me at all! indeed, it seems. But
in any case you can&#8217;t travel with a man who looks like
a tramp. I am going, as I was saying, to try and get
clean again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned then, and there was neither pain nor
surprise on her face, only relief and intense gladness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were in earnest.&#8221; It was only a
smiling reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always in earnest where you are concerned.&#8221;
I took a step or two towards her. &#8220;And you are
glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ashamed of my weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A weakness of which such a smile as that is a
fitting confession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate myself for being weak at all,&#8221; she cried
in protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be worse if you hated the cause of it.
But now it is my turn to be weak, and to lean on
you. I have no clothes to travel in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can help you there. We have many disguises
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A travelling coat is all I need, and an idea of
how we are to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always found the simplest is the best. If
you are right about the Prince, he will have given
no orders for either you or myself to be watched,
and the railway will be open. The mail leaves at
ten o&#8217;clock; open to tourists of all nations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the frontier difficulties?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>&#8220;The Russian officials are the stupidest on earth.
We shall, of course, have passports, and our papers
being in order, all will be simple. A passport can
be a very valuable friend, and those who need them
always take care they are in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought mine with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you reckoned on my going?&#8221; she asked,
smiling. &#8220;You count upon your influence with me,
it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Kalkov may communicate with the frontier
folk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should he know and why? He has, no
doubt, spies who are able to convey information to
the brotherhood; but do you think they would return
the favour? He will think they may be trusted to
do as he wished to us, and when he hears of the
failure we shall be beyond his reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an ingenious thought and probably correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You see how you help me.
We are stronger together. We will get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went first in search of Ivan, and heard from
him that our plan had succeeded entirely, and that
the men who had come in quest of Helga had all
been secured.</p>

<p>With his assistance I soon got rid of the traces
of the evening&#8217;s work, and when I saw Helga again
she was ready for the start.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Madame Korvata?&#8221; I asked, suddenly
remembering her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone to the station for our tickets. She
went long ago, before you spoke to me and while
you were with Drexel.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you had made up your mind before&mdash;before
what you said to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed slightly and her eyes brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I foresaw what I should probably have to do,&#8221;
she answered, and laughed softly. &#8220;You see, I knew
I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>&#8220;And that I should not let you go alone. I did
not see, but I do now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time to start, I think;&#8221; and she turned away.</p>

<p>Helga had indeed concluded all the arrangements,
thinking of every detail with all a woman&#8217;s eye for
small things. Madame Korvata was not to travel
with us, but to follow later. Ivan was to remain and
see to the difficulties in regard to the presence of the
men in the house, and then go into hiding until he
heard from Helga.</p>

<p>The whole affair was just cut and dried, as though
a flight from the police were an ordinary incident
of life.</p>

<p>I felt abominably nervous, I admit; disposed to
look for spies and police at every turn. But Helga
was as cool as if we had been in the States, and were
running up from New York to Saratoga for a few
days&#8217; change of air.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one point of possible danger yet&mdash;the
police may have a spy somewhere near at hand.
I doubt it, because the Prince will rely upon Drexel,
and knows that if his spy were seen, the plot against
us would fail. But I have taken care. There is a
house in the square here where the people are constant
travellers. Our carriage is there, and we shall leave
here unobserved, and pretend to come out of that
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is such a thing likely to trick them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You smile; but it is just these little simple acted
lies which make all the difference. Spies are trained
to believe what they see; no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did as Helga had said, and whether or not we
were seen I cannot say; but I saw no one, and we
found not the least difficulty with the railway officials,
who were indeed exceedingly courteous to the young
handsome French widow, Madame de Courvaix, the
name conspicuously written upon Helga&#8217;s luggage.</p>

<p>The cars were well filled, and we were not alone
in our compartment, so that I thought we had better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
speak very little. But that was not Helga&#8217;s intention.
She gave me a very meaning look, with a glance
toward our fellow-passengers, and began to chatter
at once, with all the vivacity of a Parisian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad they did not come to see us off,&#8221; she
said, as soon as the train started. &#8220;Train good-byes
are so inane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I think the General should have come, and
young Lablache from the Embassy. He promised me.
A ball-room promise, of course;&#8221; and she laughed
merrily and threw her hands up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lablache? Do I know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know him? Not by name. He is that dark
handsome man who was so nice about the flowers,
and at whom somebody I know, a stupid, jealous
somebody, looked daggers;&#8221; and she made a pretty
grimace at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that fellow!&#8221; I growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is coming to Paris next month, and has
promised to call;&#8221; and then we plunged into a conversation
about a wholly imaginary set of people, in
the course of which Helga managed most adroitly
to include a purely fictional history of herself, with
side-lights upon our relationship as an engaged couple.</p>

<p>Having done that, she settled herself in her corner,
said she was going to sleep, and advised me to do
the same; and as I was putting the rugs about her,
she managed to whisper a sentence which gave me
food for thought all through the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman&#8217;s a spy. Be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she said it she laughed gaily, and in a few
minutes closed her eyes and appeared to sleep soundly.</p>

<p>But there was no sleep for me. I forced myself
to keep my eyes closed, a continuous effort that was
infinitely taxing; and during the long, weary hours,
I think I must have pretty well exhausted in thought
all the possible dangers that might result from the
presence of so dangerous a fellow-traveller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>Helga was more than equal to the emergency, however.
In the early hours of dawn she woke, or pretended
to awake, cross and fretful, and roused me.</p>

<p>&#8220;How soundly you sleep,&#8221; she said crossly. &#8220;How
can you in this abominable stuffy atmosphere? Let
the window down, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very chilly,&#8221; I said, not understanding
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I nobody?&#8221; she cried, with a stamp of the
foot and a shrug of the shoulders. &#8220;Shall I do it
myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>I put it down a little way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wide open, I mean,&#8221; she said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very cold,&#8221; I protested; and indeed the
cold, keen air came rushing in and made me put
my collar up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, I&#8217;m stifled. Wide open, I said. That&#8217;s
better,&#8221; as I put it right down.</p>

<p>Our fellow-travellers stirred, as well they might
indeed, for the temperature ran down swiftly several
degrees. The man having heard Helga&#8217;s request was
too polite to interfere, and suffered in silence, drawing
his wraps closer round him.</p>

<p>But the woman had no such scruples, and after
a while asked me pretty sharply to close the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is open by my request, madame,&#8221; declared Helga
in a very angry tone. The woman grumbled to the
man, and at her instigation he appealed to me.</p>

<p>This was Helga&#8217;s opportunity, and she and the
woman began an altercation, which lasted for several
miles, and was waged with such bitterness that had
they been men they would have come to blows. Helga&#8217;s
fluency was too much for her opponent; besides, we
were masters of the situation; so that the window remained
open, and we shivered in victory.</p>

<p>At the first place where we stopped the quarrel
began again, and the woman appealed to the officials.</p>

<p>They were sorry, but could do nothing.</p>

<p>The conductor offered a solution, however. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
was an empty coupé on the train; would Helga remove
to it? Certainly she would not. In her beloved
France people could have a window up or down as
they pleased, and she was not going to yield her
privileges for all the cantankerous old women in
Russia put together.</p>

<p>This settled it, and with many a parting shot at
France and Frenchwomen in general, and Helga in
particular, the two got out and followed the conductor
to the other carriage.</p>

<p>As soon as we were out of the station Helga, who
had kept up her show of vociferous and gesticulating
anger, laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do put the window up, please. I&#8217;m nearly frozen
to death. I hope I haven&#8217;t given you a cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>I closed the window and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were in earnest at first,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; but I am not quite such a crochetty,
ill-tempered individual, even after a sleepless night
of doubt in a railway carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleepless?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was planning that little coup all the time, of
course. She suspects nothing, or she would have
frozen to death before she had left the carriage. She
is new to her work, so I could take a risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a wonderful actress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had a long training, and life and liberty
are bigger incentives than any salary,&#8221; she answered
thoughtfully. &#8220;Now we can sleep safely for two
hours, and then we stop for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we reached the station she said she would
not leave the carriage, so I fetched her some, and
after I had had mine, I strolled up and down, smoking.</p>

<p>Presently she called me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has happened, and whatever it is, the
officials are uneasy and excited. Go and hear what
those two are talking about;&#8221; and she pointed to
a couple of men, one of whom held a despatch in
his hand, which both were discussing eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>I strolled over to them and caught my breath
quickly as I heard one of them say something about
Nihilists and supposed flight.</p>

<p>I went up to them and put a casual question about
our train being late, intending to follow it up with
others, when some one exclaimed in English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like my infernal luck!&#8221; Recognizing the
voice, I turned, and the speaker clapped me on the
shoulder and then seized my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Harper, old fellow! What on earth brings
you here?&#8221; It was an old Harvard chum, Frank
Siegel.</p>

<p>The two officials glanced at us, and moved off as
we shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather; what are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Oh, I&#8217;m out for the Frisco Eagle&mdash;the
Screecher. I&#8217;ve been round the world for them.
Trotting home, and, like my infernal luck, I&#8217;ve just
missed a scoop in Petersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? By gee, it&#8217;s just what I&#8217;d have
given my ears to get. A big Nihilist raid. No end
of arrests; but the biggest birds are flown. May be
on this very train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard nothing of it, and I came from Petersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we on the same train? My, that&#8217;s bully.
Say, I&#8217;ll get my traps and join you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not alone, Frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about that; I shan&#8217;t mind your
friends. I&#8217;m used to all sorts of mixed company;&#8221;
and with a grin at this gibe he ran off.</p>

<p>I went back to Helga and told her what I had
heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you trust your friend?&#8221; she asked, after
a short pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, as myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let him come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>&#8220;I have already had to explain our relationship
once!&#8221; she answered, with a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I tell him we&#8217;re engaged&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; with a challenging smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will have to be in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the sooner he comes the better,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must know the news, even if we make concessions
to learn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess my news will surprise him as much as
his will us.&#8221;</p>

<p>And we were both laughing happily, despite the
ominous turn in things, when Siegel came running
up and bundled his wraps into the carriage, as I
introduced him to Helga.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">AT THE FRONTIER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FRANK SIEGEL was one of those enthusiastic
journalists to whose zeal the press of America
owes its distinctive position. Enterprise, unhampered
by too much discretion, was the gospel which had
been hammered into him. Be first, down the other
fellow, make the scoop, get the facts, discreetly if
possible, but get them, serve hot for the public taste,
and let all else go hang. The editor and the public
will forgive anything except a beat for the opposition
show.</p>

<p>Siegel lived up to this. All the world and everything
in it was to him so much copy; and he looked
at everything with an eye, and that a very sharp one,
for its newspaper possibilities.</p>

<p>When off duty his eye could also appreciate a
beautiful face, and he was charmed by Helga, who
did her utmost to win her way into his favour.</p>

<p>In particular, she was sympathetic in regard to his
present disappointment at having left Petersburg at
the moment of a Nihilist trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a sackful of dollars to get at the bottom
of a Nihilist show,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Either side,
Government or the other. What a country this would
be for a pressman, if they weren&#8217;t so tight lipped!
I&#8217;ve sent some stuff across, but of course I&#8217;ve had
to pad it a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you heard about this, M. Siegel?&#8221;
asked Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;The conductor gave it away to me. There was
a telegram telling him to look out for a woman on
the train&mdash;and a man, too, he thought; but he wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
clear. It seems a swoop was made on a haunt last
night, and a lot of arrests there and elsewhere followed.
But they wanted the woman most, and she&#8217;d gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I murmured, and Helga and I exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, what asses those Russian police must be.
Imagine what a mess we should have if we muddled
our press inquiries as they do their business. They
should apprentice a few of their fellows to the
Screecher, and let &#8217;em learn the art of making beats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beats, M. Siegel?&#8221; asked Helga, puzzled.</p>

<p>He explained the enormous virtues of exclusive
news, and gave her a telling illustration.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this were the States, which thank God it isn&#8217;t&mdash;I
can say that safely as none of us are Russians&mdash;what
would happen? Probably we should have known
all about this raid before it was ordered; but assume
we hadn&#8217;t, and it caught us by surprise. Well, we
should have had some one on the spot right there, and
the moment we heard the birds had flown we should
have wired our men to watch every train&mdash;this one
for instance, most likely with a recognizable description
of the fugitives. Say, Harper, wouldn&#8217;t it be
bully to do the trick with no machinery and spot
them on the train. What a scoop!&#8221; and he laughed
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fugitives might not relish such a press,&#8221; said
I, with more meaning than he divined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a try,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Do you
remember Marvyn, Harold Marvyn, at Harvard; that
thin dark chap we used to call the spectre? He&#8217;s at
the Embassy here, and I&#8217;ve wired him to wire me a
description of them if he can get it. I&#8217;m going to
look for &#8217;em at the frontier, and if I don&#8217;t find &#8217;em there,
I&#8217;m off back to the capital to look up things. I wish
I&#8217;d never come away; worse luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would like to hand them over to the police,
M. Siegel?&#8221; asked Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee wiss, no, madame. If we were in the States,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
yes; but here, what are the police to me? I&#8217;m thinking
of the Screecher and the interview I could get.&#8221;
Helga laughed and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And being in Russia, monsieur, if you interfered
you would probably be clapped into one of their gaols
as an accomplice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Harper,&#8221; he cried, turning to me, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t
that be just lovely! Gee, think of the headlines.
Russia&#8217;s prisons from the inside. I could make half
a column of them. Ah, I wish it could be worked,&#8221;
and he sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some queer ambitions, Siegel,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;You might find it easier to get in than to get out
again. There&#8217;s Siberia, you know&mdash;not exactly a
pleasure resort, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came through there. Looks all right from the
outside; what they let you see of it, you know; but
I&#8217;d like to scratch the surface off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might not have far to look for the fugitive
Nihilists, M. Siegel,&#8221; said Helga steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t excite his zeal,&#8221; I put in hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you help me, really?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am one and M. Denver is the other,&#8221; she replied
calmly.</p>

<p>He stared at her and then at me in amazement, and
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pulling my leg,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that means, but what I say is
true,&#8221; replied Helga.</p>

<p>He turned serious then, being convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just light the gas for me, Harper,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true. We are both Nihilist suspects and are
making a bolt for the frontier;&#8221; and I went on to
tell him something of what had got us into the mess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I use it?&#8221; he asked, his first thought naturally,
for the Screecher.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not our part; but if you care to take a hand
you can use your own experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the chance of a lifetime. Of course I will,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
he declared at once, adding characteristically: &#8220;I may
do you a turn at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Helga told her plan and we discussed it together.
Siegel&#8217;s enthusiasm rose and fell as the risk
of his being arrested in mistake appeared greater or
less. Indeed he was just as anxious to be caught as
I was to escape; and in the end we came to an
arrangement.</p>

<p>Siegel was to take my place as Harper C. Denver
and to carry my passport, and I was to take his.
Helga was to remain Madame de Courvaix and to
act independently of us both; and we were all to
travel in separate carriages and endeavour to pass the
barriers at the frontier alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am candid with you, M. Siegel,&#8221; said Helga;
&#8220;I think you will be stopped. M. Denver&#8217;s name is
known and we ought to have had another passport.
I think I shall get through, and I&#8217;m sure he will.
And that is my principal concern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try and act up to the part,&#8221; said Siegel
gleefuly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are stopped, I shall not attempt to get
through,&#8221; I said to Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is just what you must do. You must
go first. Think, if we are both stopped, how disastrous
it may be. You will take these with you;&#8221; and
she handed me the papers which had played so great
a part in the past few days. &#8220;With these, and your
freedom and your Embassy at your back, you will
gain the Emperor&#8217;s presence, and then his friendship
for you should do the rest. It is our one sound
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it looks like deserting you,&#8221; I protested. &#8220;You
ask too much. It&#8217;s cowardly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could you do if we were both detained?
You must do this. You must. And you must be the
first to pass the barrier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Harper, you can give the thing the necessary
colour by asking for that wire from Marvyn for me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>I gave in, reluctantly; and at Dunaberg, the next
stop, feeling something like a coward I left the carriage
to find a seat elsewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage, my friend,&#8221; said Helga, giving me her
hand with a smile. &#8220;Courage, and we shall make
the rest of the journey to Berlin safely and together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God it will be so,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is just bully,&#8221; cried Siegel in the highest
spirits. &#8220;See me do the conspirator when you two
are through. I hope to glory they won&#8217;t let me pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the remaining run to the frontier I was
profoundly anxious and miserable. I knew Helga
would not have taken such a step as to bring Siegel
into the matter if she had not felt there was real
danger for us both; and that she gave into my care
the papers which were of such vital import, showed
that she regarded her own chances as very doubtful.</p>

<p>I had unbounded confidence in her wit and ready
resource. She would get through if any one could;
but the gate was a very narrow one. If the new development
came from Kalkov, as I could not doubt,
she was so well known that a personal description of
her would be sent in full.</p>

<p>And then I perceived the shrewdness of her present
man&#339;uvre. Siegel and I were sufficiently alike for a
written description of one to pass for that of the other.
We were both clean shaven, somewhere about the same
build and height and colour; and when I read his
description in his identity paper&mdash;drawn up for the
purpose of his long journey through Russian territory&mdash;I
saw it was quite possible to apply it to me.</p>

<p>When we reached Vilna the official preparations
began. A number of men were at the depot and
made a careful scrutiny of the passengers, and eventually
all of them boarded the train. One got into the
compartment where I sat with Siegel&#8217;s writing case
open on my knee.</p>

<p>He watched me write for a time and then asked
me for a light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>I handed him Siegel&#8217;s matchbox&mdash;a curio he had
picked up in China&mdash;and made a commonplace
remark in execrable Russian. I had heard Siegel&#8217;s
Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur speaks French?&#8221; he asked me politely,
returning the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Un poo, pas bocoo.&#8221; He recognized the accent
immediately and smiled. &#8220;Je suis Americain; San
Francisco, voo savvy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;German, perhaps?&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya wohl, etwas; aber Englisch am besten;&#8221; and
I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak English,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and have been
in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Been in America?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and I smiled indulgently as if he had
missed Heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a writer?&#8221; he asked next with pleasant
inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m Siegel of the Screecher; which means
that,&#8221; I added in reply to his look of bewilderment,
and gave him one of Siegel&#8217;s cards. &#8220;Screecher is
American for Eagle,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;And what are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was not communicative. He smiled and gestured
deprecatingly, as if he were of no importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a private individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Travelled much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not far. To England and in France and in
Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;ve just been round the world;&#8221; and I
rattled away with a general description of many
things I did not know and many places I had not
seen; but I took care to say nothing about any part
of European Russia.</p>

<p>What did I think of Petersburg? I had only stayed
there long enough to see my friend Harold Marvyn at
the Embassy. If I&#8217;d known I&#8217;d have stayed longer;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and I skated on to the thin ice of the Nihilist raid,
playing Siegel&#8217;s part as he had performed for us. I
ended by saying I was expecting a telegram from the
Embassy at Kovna&mdash;could he tell me how to get it
quickly?</p>

<p>He could and did and offered to help me. On this
I became professionally confidential. I told him my
wish to know more of the Nihilist business, and asked
him whether it would probably be worth my while to
return to Petersburg; and so managed that he was led
to ask all about me and my newspaper. Then I showed
him enough to convince him of my good faith.</p>

<p>I watched him gradually lose interest in me and my
concerns; and I knew from this that any suspicions
or hopes about me, with which he had entered the
carriage were dissipated. I was not a Nihilist; no
credit was to be gained from detecting and arresting
me; and he wished to bother himself no more about
me.</p>

<p>We were in this stage of the proceedings, and I was
wondering whether Siegel had also been interviewed
and if so with what results, when my companion said
we were close to Kovna and that I had better put my
things together. He was kind enough to assist me
and I noticed that he was at great pains to see as
many of my papers as he could and to read them. I
gave him ample opportunity; and an easy-going fool
he no doubt thought me in consequence.</p>

<p>At Kovna his confidence in my good faith communicated
itself to the other officials and my path
was made easy in consequence. He walked with me
to the barrier; a significant glance or two passed between
him and the officials; a very cursory look was
taken at my passport and I was through.</p>

<p>I had not risked looking for either Helga or Siegel;
but when I had passed through I hung about and soon
made a discovery which filled me with concern.</p>

<p>A great distinction was made between the men and
the women. Scarcely any difficulty was made in regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
to the men; some sharp glances and a few questions
at the most. But all the women between twenty
and fifty years of age were taken away for separate
examination.</p>

<p>I saw Helga come up, hand over her passport, and
submit to the close and searching scrutiny with a kind
of impatient frankness that was admirable acting. But
she was led away like the rest for further examination
of her papers.</p>

<p>I was waiting with an anxiety which can be imagined
for her to appear again, when I was witness
of the little comedy in which Siegel played the chief
part.</p>

<p>He had put up his coat collar and drawn down his
cap so that as little of his face as possible was to be
seen, and he came striding along casting quick suspicious
glances on all sides, much after the manner of
the conventional conspirator of burlesque.</p>

<p>In this way he tried to thrust his way past the
officials. Any one with the faintest sense of humour
would have seen he was fooling; but humour is not
the strong point of Russian officialism. The men by
the barrier whispered together as he approached and
then clustered close like wasps round an over ripe
peach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your passport, monsieur, if you please,&#8221; said one,
stopping him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Passport, what do you mean?&#8221; he asked in a
truly cosmopolitan language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your passport; you know what that is,&#8221; said the
man trying French.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t one,&#8221; he answered. He told me afterwards
he had intentionally torn up mine, thinking he
had better leave the officials to connect him with me.
&#8220;Americans don&#8217;t want passports.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t tell you. I&#8217;m an American, that&#8217;s enough.
Don&#8217;t you interfere with me,&#8221; he said threateningly;
and made as if to go on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>Half a dozen hands were thrust out instantly to
stop him. One man tried to see more of his face and
was glancing at a paper. He whispered something to
his colleague, who asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you raise your hat, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot pass, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that;&#8221; and he drew his hands
from his pockets and clenched his fists. I really feared
he was going to show fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you step this way, if you please, monsieur?&#8221;
said an elderly man coming forward. Apparently a
man in higher authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; asked Siegel brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has probably been some mistake which I
can put right for you,&#8221; was the suavely spoken reply.
&#8220;You can then resume your journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Siegel, after a moment&#8217;s pause;
and the two went off followed by several of the other
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it is?&#8221; asked one of the officials at
the barrier of his colleague.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it is,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;He&#8217;ll resume his
journey all right, but&mdash;&#8221; he jerked his thumb backwards
and winked. And the incident was closed so far
as the public were concerned.</p>

<p>The women passengers were now beginning to come
out from a separate door; but I saw nothing of Helga
and my hopes for her safety ebbed as the number of
the women increased.</p>

<p>Some of them were speaking of their examination,
and I heard to my dismay that in more than one case
there had been a most rigorous personal search. They
were loud in protest at the indignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;She actually made me take down my hair to see
if I had anything concealed in it,&#8221; said a German
woman to a friend, as the two passed me. &#8220;You
never saw such a disgraceful scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still there was no sign of Helga; and keen though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
I was for news of her, when we were told the train
would soon start, I dared not linger lest I should draw
attention and suspicion upon myself.</p>

<p>I was in a fever of anxiety during the last few
minutes as I stood by the door of the car straining
my hungry eyes in vain for a sight of her.</p>

<p>Then the detective who had been on the train with
me came along, his face wearing a satisfied expression.
He caught sight of me, smiled and nodded as he passed,
then stopped, turned and came up and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bon voyage, monsieur. Then you are not going
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still in two minds. But I suppose it&#8217;s nothing
serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke as indifferently as I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no&mdash;not for your country. I don&#8217;t know,
though. I could give you some news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always ready for that,&#8221; I replied with an eager
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a police agent,&#8221; he said, as if the admission
would astound me. I was therefore promptly
astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Impossible. Why, I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and left the thought to his imagination.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>did</i> you think?&#8221; He chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put you down for a merchant or a landowner.
But a police agent!&#8221; and I waved my hand in amazement.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always heard you are the smartest men
in Europe. Now I know it. A police agent!&#8221; I was
lost in wonderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what I thought you were?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t take me for another, I suppose?&#8221; It
was a joke and he enjoyed it and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thought you were a Nihilist!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Nihilist! Well, that&#8217;s worse than ever. An
American a Nihilist?&#8221;</p>

<p>The thing was incredulous as my tone showed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They come from all countries, monsieur. I was
looking for a countryman of yours, a Mr. Damper&mdash;no,
Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>&#8220;Great Scott. You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We caught him, too. He was in the train; and a
woman too&mdash;one of the most dangerous Nihilists in
the Empire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman! Oh, you police agents are wonderful!
But do you mean that women are in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are often the worst. She is a pretty
woman, too, this one. You&#8217;d better get in, monsieur,
there&#8217;s the signal&mdash;unless you think of going
back to Petersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is the next train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Starts in an hour from now. But you can catch
the return mail at Insterburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;ll be better. I can get my baggage.
If I do come back I shall look out for you,&#8221; I said, as
I got into the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back at once to Vilna. Bon voyage,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye. A pretty woman you say? Will it go
hard with her, do you suppose?&#8221; I asked in a compassionate
tone as the train moved.</p>

<p>He shook his head and smiled significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll go to the mines, if what they say is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was what that infernal old Kalkov had said;
and he was making his words good.</p>

<p>And it was from that I had to save her.</p>

<p>Thank God she had been shrewder than I; and
that I was free to make my effort.</p>

<p>If I had been in Siegel&#8217;s place&mdash;and then despite
the tragedy I thought of the comedy and smiled.</p>

<p>But the smile was very fleeting.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIV</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE FRESH
CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was fortunate for my peace of mind in the hours
which followed Helga&#8217;s arrest that I did not know
a number of grim facts that afterwards came to my
knowledge about Russian methods in dealing with
certain classes of offenders.</p>

<p>Her case was bad enough at the best. Prince
Kalkov was one of the most dangerous men in the
Empire to have for an enemy; and that he was
Helga&#8217;s bitter enemy he had shown already. Her
secret attack had threatened his influence and position
and had thus roused him to vigorous measures
of self-defence.</p>

<p>As I recalled my last interview with him, I saw
now that he had deliberately goaded me to passion
and then let drop the hint of possible escape in order
to drive me to make the attempt which he had planned
to end fatally for me. And in thus goading me he
had shown his hand against her so openly, because he
believed I should not live to speak of it.</p>

<p>I thought I could see something more, too. He had
not scrupled first to use the brotherhood for his own
purposes against Helga, and then had swooped down
upon them at the moment they were serving his end
and had made the raid upon them. In this way he had
probably calculated not only to demonstrate the vigilance
of his agents but also to secure the silence of
the men he had used, should anything compromising
to him transpire.</p>

<p>As the result of that raid he had found that Helga<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
had slipped through his net and had taken the papers
with her; and had learnt from Drexel no doubt, that
I had been with her at the house.</p>

<p>The hue and cry had followed which had led to
the arrest of Helga and, as he had no doubt been informed,
of myself as well.</p>

<p>The net had been cast wide and, as both the birds
had seemingly been caught in its meshes, he would
probably feel easy enough in mind.</p>

<p>There was only one point in which he had failed.
He had not secured the precious papers; and I had
to consider what he was likely to do in consequence.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that under the circumstances
although he might possibly see Helga to question
her, he was not likely to see Siegel. In my last
interview he had threatened to have me charged with
Vastic&#8217;s murder, and I had left him to do it; and this
was no doubt the charge which Siegel would find himself
called upon to face. He would have no difficulty
whatever in meeting it, of course, the moment he chose
to open his lips; but as he wished to learn at first
hand the secrets of the Russian prison, he would not
speak for a while.</p>

<p>I should thus have time to operate, and my course
was fairly clear. I had to get to the Emperor himself
with my story before Kalkov had any suspicion that
I was not safely under lock and key. If he knew I was
still at liberty he would put insuperable difficulties in
my way, as he had before.</p>

<p>I left the cars at Insterburg accordingly and caught
the limited back to the capital. The journey was without
incident. I was recognized at Kovna; but no
questions save those prompted by curiosity were asked
me.</p>

<p>My friend the police agent had spoken about me to
one or two of the officials, and what he had said had
apparently been very much in my favour. The elderly
man whom I had seen lead Siegel away at the moment
when he seemed about to show fight, was particularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
gracious to me; and after a general query or so, he
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was the American whom we arrested here a friend
of yours, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, in a sense all Americans are friends,&#8221;
I replied evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some sixty millions of us Americans;&#8221;
and I laughed. &#8220;Are you sure he was an American?&#8221;
I preferred to do the questioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would say nothing, not even his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I see him? I might by chance know him.
A newspaper man gets to know a lot of faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been sent back to the capital. If I can
venture to warn you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused and looked
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be only too glad of a hint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not seek him out then, if I were you.
We know little about him, but in our instructions the
charge is an ugly one.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when we Americans take a thing up we
generally do it in earnest, whatever it is. But I don&#8217;t
believe any American would ever turn Nihilist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you have had Anarchists in your country.
Some of your Presidents have been assassinated, monsieur;
is it not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By madmen or wild European scum; not by
honest Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows, smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The disease is the same in all countries. This
man is a murderer, monsieur,&#8221; he answered slowly
and emphatically. &#8220;He was escaping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Siegel! I could have laughed again; but did
not. I was appropriately shocked, almost horror-struck,
at the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is terrible,&#8221; I said, gravely. &#8220;One cannot wish
to help such a criminal as a murderer, even if he be
one&#8217;s own countryman;&#8221; and with that we parted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>The one item of fact I had gathered was that the
prisoners had been sent back to Petersburg; and in
the hours of my journey I had ample time to consider
my plans, and had them pretty well cut and
dried when I reached the capital.</p>

<p>I chose a quiet hotel for the night, registered myself
as Frank Siegel of San Francisco, and after a supper
served in my own rooms, I went straight to bed.</p>

<p>I took all the precautions I could to avoid observation,
of course, as I had to face the double risk of
recognition by the Nihilists and by any of Prince
Kalkov&#8217;s agents.</p>

<p>In the morning I commenced my work. I drove to
the American Embassy and sent up Siegel&#8217;s card to
Harold Marvyn.</p>

<p>I was shown up to his room and as I entered he
jumped up from his table and came toward me, with
hand extended. Then he stopped suddenly and with
a very sharp look said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They brought me Mr. Siegel&#8217;s card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you recognize me?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, you are Harper C. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; And we shook hands. He was obviously
perplexed and stood fingering Siegel&#8217;s card.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve puzzled you; but for the moment
Siegel and I have changed personalities. It&#8217;s a queer
show. But he&#8217;s in prison and I&#8217;m here to tell you all
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marvyn was never a very demonstrative man and
his diplomatic training had increased his capacity for
self-restraint. But my quiet statement was too much
for him. He went back to his seat, and as I drew a
chair close to his table, he stared at me, his thin sallow
face all lines of surprise, and letting out a long breath
in a sort of mixed sigh and whistle he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m gormed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered his expression at Harvard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard that since you left Harvard,&#8221; I
said, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>&#8220;But what does it all mean? What are you doing
here? How is that&mdash;here, show me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means a most infernal mess, which can all soon
be put right, however, if I can keep my head and you
can keep my secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Denver, I&#8217;ll do anything in the world
for you. It was your father got me into this, you
know. But is it official?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of everything, I think. But you give me
your word not to repeat anything I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For one thing I want your people here to get me
a personal audience with the Czar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Czar! Well, that&#8217;s a pretty tall proposition
as a start. But I daresay it can be done. We&#8217;re on
excellent terms with Prince Kalkov who arranges such
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But old Kalkov&#8217;s just the man who must know
nothing about it. He&#8217;s the man I&#8217;m fighting; so
I&#8217;ll drop that part of the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fighting? How&#8217;s that? Give me some facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll begin backwards,&#8221; and I told him
about Siegel&#8217;s arrest; and then little by little most
of the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me anything about the contents of those
papers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It might be very inconvenient
knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t; I don&#8217;t know them myself; but it&#8217;s in
regard to them I want your assistance. Of course I
don&#8217;t mean to compromise you in any way officially.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re trying to weave cloth of spider&#8217;s
webs with a hornet&#8217;s sting for the shuttle, Denver.
My advice to you in regard to those papers is&mdash;burn
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I were in your place here, I daresay I
should; but you understand that officially you know
nothing about them. All that I wish you to do is to
receive for safe custody the property of an American
citizen to be dealt with as that citizen desires.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well, but if any fuss came and
enquiries were made about them, think what a stink
there might be,&#8221; he objected nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you for all I know to the contrary they may
be mere sheets of blank paper. I hand you two packets
of valuable securities, that&#8217;s all; and I ask you to
accept instructions as to their disposition. You can
surely do that? If an American can&#8217;t get a trifle like
that done for him in his own country&#8217;s Embassy, it&#8217;s
a pretty pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what are your instructions?&#8221; he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall either call here every day before twelve
o&#8217;clock or send you a letter before that time, requesting
you to hold them for a further twenty-four hours.
If you do not see or hear from me, you are to hand
them over to the person who produces a letter from
me dated to-day, requesting you to deliver them to the
bearer, and signed by me in this fashion: &#8216;Harper
Clarence Denver, sophomore, citizen of the United
States.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who will present that letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with the Embassy? It will
be signed in that way to prevent any forgery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can do that,&#8221; he agreed after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you can; and there is only one thing further.
The day you part with them ask your friend,
Prince Kalkov, in what prison he has ventured to
lock me up, and use all the powers of the Embassy to
find me. You may gamble on it that I shall need all
the help you can afford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it, Denver, and that&#8217;s the truth. I
wish you&#8217;d let us take the thing up in the usual
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, that&#8217;s just a sheer impossibility.
I know where I&#8217;m walking in this thing. I mean to
win right along. This is no mere bluff I&#8217;m putting
up: I hold a straight flush.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pressed the matter very insistently and in the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
gained my point, although I should not have done so,
had not Marvyn felt under a considerable obligation
to me as the son of the man who had helped him, and
whose influence could be depended upon to see him
through any bother. He yielded with great reluctance.
Still, he yielded, and that was all I needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about Siegel?&#8221; he asked, when my
point was settled and I had written the necessary
letters and given into his charge the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may safely wait until you hear from him or
me. When the mistake is discovered they will be as
anxious to get rid of him as he was that they should
make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting the &#8216;copy&#8217; he wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be a row about it,&#8221; said Marvyn, who
appeared to have a far scent for trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for newspaper purposes,&#8221; I answered as I
left.</p>

<p>I was in high spirits at my first success. I had
planted the compromising papers where even Kalkov&#8217;s
iron hand would be powerless to reach them, and I had
now only to complete the machinery by which they
were to fall into the right hands if trouble came my
way.</p>

<p>I drove to the Embassy of the Power chiefly concerned
and asked for the man there whom Helga had
mentioned to me. I sent up no name at first and consequently
met with a courteous refusal and a request
to put my business in writing.</p>

<p>Give my own name I could not just yet, so I sent
up one of Siegel&#8217;s cards, marking it on urgent private
business. After some little farther trouble this had
the requisite effect, and I was shown into the presence
of a man some fifty years of age, thin and tall, with a
military carriage, clean shaven, with one of those
straight almost lipless mouths you see in men of secretive
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Siegel?&#8221; he asked in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we quite alone?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>His eyes asked me what I meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see, sir,&#8221; was what his lips said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you answer my question, please?&#8221; I persisted.
I had my reasons; for there was a big screen
in the room and I had heard things.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can rely upon everything being confidential.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pointed to the screen and looked at him. He
started.</p>

<p>&#8220;A screen always suggests draughts to me. Permit
me to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need,&#8221; he interposed quickly, as I was
moving toward it. &#8220;It is usual to have a memorandum
of matters that pass here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged for the thoughtfulness, but I
can trust my memory,&#8221; I answered drily; and then he
sent some one out of the room and himself folded the
screen together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Siegel,&#8221; he said referring to the
card.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not Mr. Siegel and have no connection with
the press of any country. I wished to see you on
something of extreme importance and of a vitally
confidential nature. I used that name to gain this
interview.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your own name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is for the moment of no concern. You would not
know it, but will of course learn it if this interview
ends as I wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be seated?&#8221; and he motioned to a chair.</p>

<p>I drew my chair close to his and waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can speak more easily to you here;&#8221; and I
pointed to the seat at his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mysterious, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; only cautious. I don&#8217;t intend to be overheard,&#8221;
I replied quietly. He took his seat then and
turned to me a listening but impassive face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had some negotiations recently in regard to
certain papers?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Recognition and interest now took the
place of impassiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have come into my possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is of no consequence. I have them. And&mdash;&#8221;
I paused and met his intent gaze&mdash;&#8220;they may find
their way to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The price, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean money? I am not for sale. I say they
<i>may</i> find their way to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet my words speak my meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom do you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my own initiative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the papers?&#8221; and his eyes shot at me
as if to pierce to my pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in perfectly safe keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in some personal danger&mdash;possibly great
danger&mdash;and if anything should befall me, I intend
those papers to come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw my meaning in a flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;You intend to use that as a means to restrain those
who threaten you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221; There was no change in his expression
but I read his silence, and added: &#8220;You can get them
in no other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made up his mind then promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your terms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask little except absolute secrecy about myself.
If you consent, I shall leave with you a letter to those
who will upon receipt of it hand you documents which
will tell you precisely where and how to get the papers
you wish, and will be a full authority to secure their
being handed to you. There are two sets of documents.
One is for your use: the other you must give
me a pledge to have placed in the hands of the Czar
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>I did not tell him he would get the papers themselves
from Marvyn, nor that they were actually at
the American Embassy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is all why not give them me at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will only present the letter I shall give you
under certain conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That on any day you fail either to see me or hear
from me by noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask nothing from us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing more than I have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No assistance, should you get into this danger
you anticipate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could render none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept your conditions, of course. But I wish
you would give them me at once. We would find
means to protect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. That is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wrote the letter in the terms I had agreed with
Marvyn and handed it to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name you will see is Denver,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Marvyn, of your Embassy. I know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pledge of secrecy must be kept, or the whole
thing falls through. I have arranged that. The slightest
breath, and the papers are lost to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Marvyn know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Marvyn knows no more about them than the
secretary you sent out of the room. I have left with
him the particulars which will enable you to get the
papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On your side, Mr. Denver, you will observe
confidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled as I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they are to fall into your hands, I shall be in
a place where my silence will be very effectively
secured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not ask about that,&#8221; he said as I rose. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
you will render us a service we should never forget,
Mr. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, I may do so. There&#8217;s an &#8216;if&#8217; in the
matter, and I hope it will be the strongest word in the
whole conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left him then to set about the still more difficult
task of getting my audience with his Majesty.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXV</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE LUCK WAVERS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; WAS very preoccupied with my plans as I left
the Foreign Embassy, and, crossing the side
path quickly, ran against a man, who turned, stared,
started, and muttering some words I did not catch,
passed on.</p>

<p>Something about him struck me as familiar, and I
glanced after him with half a mind to follow and speak
to him. But time was pressing. It was already mid-day,
and I had yet to devise a means of getting at the
Emperor; so I entered my carriage and drove back
to the hotel.</p>

<p>The incident had served to revive my caution, however,
and when I alighted I had a good look about me.
There were but few people about, and none to take
any notice of me; but while I still stood in the lobby,
a drosky drove rapidly past, and in it was the man
whom I had jostled some minutes before.</p>

<p>Obviously I had been followed; and having ordered
my lunch to be sent to my rooms, I went up feeling
vaguely uneasy and worried.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face would obtrude itself into my
thoughts, and my vain efforts to place him in my
memory troubled me. In the last few crowded days
I had seen such a number of different faces that my
recollection of this one was lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>That any one should have recognized me at such
a moment was annoying; and whoever the man might
be, and whatever his object in following me, I foresaw
the possibility of embarrassing complications, and even
of dangerous ones.</p>

<p>Without interference from any one, the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
in the path of getting to the Czar&#8217;s presence were of
themselves likely to tax my ingenuity to the utmost.
Even when I had been his guest in the Palace they had
proved insuperable, and now they threatened to be no
less troublesome. A hundred different suggestions occurred
to me, only to be put on one side.</p>

<p>You cannot walk up to an Emperor&#8217;s door, send in
your card, and see him without any fuss; and if I
was to succeed now, it would only be as a result of
some ruse.</p>

<p>For this there was only one thing which might tell
in my favour. I knew my way about the Palace, and
on the night of my arrival I had been seen by, and my
name was known to, one or two of the gentlemen-in-waiting.
If I could get inside the building, therefore,
I might by the use of a little impudence and ingenuity
gain my end.</p>

<p>In this connection I had a stroke of luck. I learned
from the papers that the Czar had returned late on the
previous evening with his guest, the Crown Prince of
Denmark; and I saw how to make use of this visit
for my purpose.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince and his staff were staying in the
Palace, and the fact of there being so many new faces
to puzzle the officials would help me. I resolved to go
to the Palace quite openly, ask for one of the Prince&#8217;s
staff, and while he was being sought, I proposed to
lose myself somewhere in the building, and trust to
my wits for the rest.</p>

<p>To ask openly for an audience of the Emperor
would, of course, be useless, because, as Marvyn himself
had admitted, all such requests were referred
straight to Prince Kalkov.</p>

<p>I found a list of the members of the staff in a
morning paper and picked out a name at random:
that of a Colonel von Kramen: and over my lunch
arranged the details of my venture. If I came actually
face to face with him, I could easily use Siegel&#8217;s
connection with the Screecher to carry me through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>I fixed the time for my visit for about five in the
afternoon. I knew the Czar&#8217;s habit was to devote
himself to matters of business for an hour or two
from five o&#8217;clock; and if I could get my name before
him then with a pressing request for an audience,
I reckoned all the rest would be plain sailing.</p>

<p>I ordered a carriage to be ready by half-past four,
and sat down to wait for the time to pass with such
patience as I could command; and I was just finishing
my cigar when the waiter interrupted me with an
announcement that brought me to my feet in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother to see you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother!&#8221; I exclaimed, and got no farther
before the man who had followed me to the hotel
rushed in with both hands extended and face beaming
with smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Frank, my brother, my brother,&#8221; he cried in
broken English, and with a very effusive foreign
manner.</p>

<p>I drew back and stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>The waiter stood staring at us in amused astonishment.
The ways of these Americans were always
droll, of course, to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Frank, brother, why receive me thus coldly?
Why this cruel estrangement? This freezing stare?&#8221;
exclaimed my visitor as the waiter, after lounging a
moment, went out and closed the door. Then the
newcomer&#8217;s manner changed. &#8220;Or am I mistaken,
and is it&mdash;the Emperor?&#8221; the last sentence in a low,
sly tone with a look of intense cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who the devil you are, but you&#8217;ve
no business here anyway, so get out, right now,&#8221; I
said angrily.</p>

<p>He took no notice and stood staring at me with the
same smile of cunning. Then shaking his head as if
in reproach, he sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my room. Get out of it,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>He did not move, so I crossed to the bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>&#8220;Shall I call some one to pitch you out?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spread his hands and wagged his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will not do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see;&#8221; and I touched it.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will not do that,&#8221; he declared, unmoved.
&#8220;You will not tell them to. I should only say I am
looking for an American gentleman I had the good
fortune to meet at&mdash;Brabinsk, and think I have found
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled with the same serene cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; I asked angrily.</p>

<p>The waiter opened the door then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is more like my brother. I will have
cognac and cigars and coffee. The sight of your dear
face, brother, is a delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring cigars, coffee, and brandy,&#8221; I told the waiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was I not right? You no longer order me out.
On the contrary, we drink together, and smoke and&mdash;and
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>I waited until the drinks came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; I told him; and he did, generously.
Russians can all drink like fish, and this one
took half a tumbler of brandy and very nearly forgot
all about the water. Then leisurely he lit a cigar, and
having got rid of the waiter&#8217;s curious eyes, rose and
locked the door, and tossed the key on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have another brother, monsieur, and
he would not be so welcome;&#8221; and with a fresh smile
he sat down again and puffed away in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good cigar,&#8221; he said appreciatively.</p>

<p>His coolness was amazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you were going to talk&mdash;well, talk, and
say what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to do you a good service, monsieur; I am
your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that, what do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took up his glass and looked at the liquor in it
deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;A toast, monsieur. To the memory of&mdash;M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Vastic,&#8221; and he tossed off half the liquor at a gulp.
&#8220;You do not drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m waiting for you to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a great man&mdash;Vastic. But you were too
quick for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you&mdash;?&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>He nodded his head quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I missed you. It is not often I miss. I am counted
a dead shot;&#8221; and with a glance the mingled threat
and cunning of which no words of mine can convey,
he took out a revolver and laid it on the table in his
hand.</p>

<p>The interest of the situation heightened considerably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come for a second shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not; I hope it will not come to that. I
should not miss a second time. Perhaps you have
arms here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have,&#8221; I answered coolly, meeting his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would help to give them me.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stared steadily at one another, and then I noticed
that the door key was within my reach. I leaned
forward slightly, as if to be nearer him, and then
picked up the key with my left hand, and thrust back
my chair so that my right hand rested on the bell
push. As I moved, he watched me like a cat, and
partly raised the revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will do for me,&#8221; I answered, slipping the key
into an inner pocket and putting my finger on the bell.
&#8220;You can shoot me if you wish, but at the slightest
movement from you I shall ring this bell, and you will
find it difficult to get out of the room before the people
come&mdash;and equally difficult to explain your presence.
Now we can talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dead tense silence followed my words. I sat
staring at him, with my finger on the push. His
fingers left the revolver and he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are clever, monsieur. But it would not have
saved you. You are right, however. We will talk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>&#8220;Say what you have to say,&#8221; I answered, keeping
my hand on the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I spare you, you can save me. And we shall be
quits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his hand from his revolver and used it
to lift the glass which he drained and immediately
replenished.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember me then, monsieur?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, perfectly, now. You were with M. Vastic
at Brabinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you shot him,&#8221; he added significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the moment he was attempting to shoot me.
Yes, go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For that you were condemned by the brotherhood,
and I was one of those chosen to&mdash;to find you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And murder me, you mean&mdash;after having been
a witness that I acted only in self-defence. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know what occurred,&#8221; he answered with a
wave of the hand, as if putting my words aside.
Then his look sharpened. &#8220;I am now the only one
at large of all who were at Brabinsk that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I am your only source of danger&mdash;from us,
monsieur. It is fortunate that I chanced to see you
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be two opinions about that,&#8221; I said
drily. &#8220;I have mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fortunate&mdash;for both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That gun of yours is scarcely a promising circumstance,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make me your friend, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in danger, almost at my last turn. I am
being hunted down&mdash;and you can save me. Every
refuge is closed by these dogs of police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I can call them off? I&#8217;m no longer
even playing at being Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no money, monsieur&mdash;and dare not go
where I could get it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>So the cat was belled at last. To my profound relief,
the desperate Nihilist and picked assassin was
just a common beggar, and his six shooter and threats
mere picturesque bits of stage colour, and no more.
An almost ludicrous bathos, but yet unutterably welcome
to me.</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s reflection convinced me that he was
in earnest. I knew of the raid on the Nihilists and
that there had been a great number of arrests. Panic
had no doubt seized the bulk of them, as it will do at
such moments, and this man had caught the infection:
oaths, pledges, revenge, the brotherhood, friends,
everything had been blown to the winds by the passion
of the panic and fear for his skin.</p>

<p>I took my hand from the bell and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I said quietly, in a tone of reassurance.
&#8220;Put that gun away and don&#8217;t monkey with it any
longer. I&#8217;ll help you if only to show I&#8217;ve no cause
of enmity with you. You shall get out of the country
if you wish. How much do you want?&#8221; and without
more ado I pulled out a roll of notes.</p>

<p>This readiness completed his conquest. He tried
to maintain some show of stolid indifference, but the
sight of the money and the knowledge of all it meant
was too much for him; and for the moment he could
not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; I asked again. &#8220;Five hundred
roubles?&#8221; and I laid notes for that amount on the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need so much as that,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll comply with one condition, I&#8217;ll double
the amount.&#8221;</p>

<p>His quick glance asked my meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the one man whose evidence can prove
what took place when Vastic was killed. Leave Russia
and go to any place you please, but let me know where
to find you; you can write to Mr. Harold Marvyn, of
the American Embassy here. And if I need your evidence,
be ready to swear to what occurred at Brabinsk.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Do this, and I&#8217;ll see that you have a fair start in a new
country. You&#8217;re not of the stuff that makes good
conspirators. Come; your gun, right now, as a pledge
you trust me and will do what I say.&#8221; And I held out
my hand for it.</p>

<p>He hesitated, looking at me nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a prisoner, monsieur,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish! Here,&#8221; and I tossed the key of the
room over to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, you&#8217;re a man!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You make
me feel like a vile wretch of a coward;&#8221; and he
pushed the revolver toward me. &#8220;I was drawn into
this thing, like so many others, and the net was too
strong to break. But I could get away now, and if
you&#8217;ll give me a chance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Here&#8217;s the money. I&#8217;ll have your
story when we meet outside your infernal country.
Now go, I&#8217;m busy. By the way, what&#8217;s your
name?&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up the notes almost like a man in a
dream and as if he could not believe in his good fortune,
and put them away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Anton Presvitch. What can I say to you,
monsieur? I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say <i>au revoir</i> or any other old tag you please, and
keep clear of this sort of business for the future. I
wish you good luck in getting away;&#8221; and I opened
the door, gave him back his revolver and bundled him
out.</p>

<p>The time was now close at hand for me to start,
and I hurried my final preparations.</p>

<p>My chief concern as I drove to the Palace was lest
any of the men who had stopped me on the previous
morning should be on duty and recognize me; but
the luck continued to be on my side.</p>

<p>No difficulty was raised about taking Siegel&#8217;s card
to Colonel von Kramen, and I was shown into an
ante-room to wait. But I was not left alone, and could
not therefore find means to get further into the Palace.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
But I was in luck again. Instead of the colonel, a
young officer came to me, who said he was his secretary,
and politely asked my business.</p>

<p>I invented a reply to the effect that the paper I
represented wished me to get the career of so distinguished
an officer as the colonel, and that I was
very anxious to have a personal interview. I would
not detain him more than a few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s out of the question just now. The
colonel is with his Royal Highness, and can scarcely
be interrupted,&#8221; he said, as if with regret. &#8220;Cannot
I tell you what you wish to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m also going to ask the colonel to endeavour to
get me a word with his Royal Highness,&#8221; I answered
glibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; He smiled. &#8220;I have heard of the
enterprise of American newspapers, but I scarcely
expected this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a usual thing,&#8221; I replied, as if it were. &#8220;In
fact I am known to the Czar himself, and have had
the honour of a long conversation with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This impressed him, as I intended it should.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see what I can do,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>He was a very pleasant young fellow, so I ventured
a step further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there not some place where we could be more
private than here? In a confidential matter of this
sort&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I left the rest to his imagination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to my apartments? I shall be
delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course I agreed, but felt rather like a shame-faced
impostor at having to trick so frank and good-natured
a fellow. There was too much at stake,
however, for me to hesitate, and we went away together,
talking gaily, up the stairs and along the
corridors to his room.</p>

<p>I was going to win after all, in spite of old Kalkov
and his Argus eyes, and my spirits rose as success
came nearer and nearer within my grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>We sat chatting for a few minutes, the young officer
exhibiting a strong curiosity on the subject of American
newspapers, what information I wished to obtain,
the use I should make of it, and so on; and I did my
best to satisfy him.</p>

<p>He was satisfied at length apparently, for he went
off on his search for the colonel and left me alone.</p>

<p>I gave him just time to get well away, and then
hurried off in the direction of the rooms where I
knew the Czar would be at that hour.</p>

<p>What happened when the young secretary returned
to find I had hoaxed him, I do not know, and never
had an opportunity of ascertaining. He went out of
my thoughts there and then, and the occurrences of
the next few hours were too vital for me to think
of him again.</p>

<p>I had to get to the Czar, and assuming an air of
as much importance as I could, and feeling, it must
be confessed, not a little nervous, I strode into the
ante-room, my pulse beating with the fear that Prince
Kalkov might be there, and said to one of the aides-de-camp,
as I handed him my card&mdash;my own card
this time&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kindly let his Majesty know that I have obeyed
his summons and am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aide looked up and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no note of your name, monsieur. What
is your business, if you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here by his Majesty&#8217;s request. I was staying
in the Palace as his Majesty&#8217;s guest until the last
two days. I am going to Khiva, and his Majesty
wished to see me first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I heard of that. Pray pardon me; you
are the American, M. Denver, yes. His Majesty is
engaged at present, but the audience will be over
directly, and if he sent for you, of course he will see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was to see him before I left. But my name will
be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>&#8220;Will you wait, monsieur?&#8221; And he waved me
to an adjoining room.</p>

<p>Good old bluff! The finest of all tactics, I thought
as I sat, very anxious and impatient I admit, but very
confident now. Once get the Czar&#8217;s ear, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>The door was pushed partly open, and there came
a dramatic pause. I got up, eager and expectant; and
the luck turned with a rush.</p>

<p>It was Prince Kalkov, pale, urbane, cool and
dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, M. Denver, his Majesty is too much
engaged to grant you an audience to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>This in the suavest of tones, for those outside to
hear. Then he closed the door and smiled.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXVI</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">I WIN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY feelings as Prince Kalkov and I stood thus
face to face for some half minute or so without
speaking were not wholly those of disappointment
and chagrin. Disappointed I was, of course, and chagrined;
but I had throughout had the secret expectation
that he would succeed in blocking my way to
the Czar; and it was in view of this that I had taken
the elaborate precautions in regard to the compromising
papers.</p>

<p>My surprise passed very quickly therefore, and I
was conscious of a feeling of amusement mingled
with conjecture as to the course which the interview
would take. I had no fear of him whatever, for I was
absolutely confident.</p>

<p>He might do what he pleased, but I had the stock
of the whip in my hand, and there were two long
biting thongs on it.</p>

<p>I sat down on the edge of an office table, and
swinging my leg carelessly, smiled and opened the
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so entirely surprised to see you as you
may think&mdash;nor so sorry. I would rather see his
Majesty, but that will come presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You play very adroitly and very confidently, M.
Denver. Who is in your place yonder&mdash;your cell?&#8221;</p>

<p>I affected not to understand him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need we pretend? What American has personated
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one, Prince; I am not an Emperor.&#8221; Then
in an indifferent tone I added: &#8220;Have you got an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
American? I heard as I came back through Kovna
that your people had blundered and had made an
arrest. I think something was said about a murder,
but, of course, we know that&#8217;s all mere wishwash and
wind baggery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find it serious enough, monsieur. Who
is he?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>I pretended to think a moment, then slapped my
knee and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, I believe I can guess it. Splendid. There
<i>was</i> an American, a newspaper man, on the train,
represents the most sensational papers in the States;
he was dying to get the secrets of your prisons at
first hand, and it&#8217;s just like him to have played for
this arrest. You&#8217;ll have a flaring description of the
one he&#8217;s in sent across the Atlantic. Lovely!&#8221; and I
laughed with unnecessary heartiness. &#8220;You&#8217;d better
get him out as soon as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eye kindled with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there has been a conspiracy, monsieur, it will
not help you now, and he will pay the penalty. We
are not to be fooled with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the point. The worse you treat him,
the better he&#8217;ll like it, and the more his papers will
make of it,&#8221; I replied, taking out my cigar case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are his papers, monsieur?&#8221; he retorted
pointedly.</p>

<p>I grew serious and looked up at him out of the
corner of my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to talk about&mdash;papers yet, Prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>His momentary discomfiture was a thing of joy
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not realize the fix you have got him into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed, for I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s in any fix
at all. By the way, shall I have time to smoke a
cigar before I see his Majesty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, many,&#8221; he rapped out drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here goes for one, then,&#8221; and I lit mine
deliberately. &#8220;Now I suppose we are going to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
a little chat together. I think you&#8217;ll be interested in
an account of my adventures since&mdash;yes, since the
night before last at&mdash;seven o&#8217;clock. You know them
up to then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unusual for me to grant an interview to a
man charged with murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d better go straight to his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not see his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can persuade you that I shall, Prince.
As you said just now, I am very confident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you desire to lay any mitigating facts before
me, I will listen to you in my apartments. I am wishful
to deal with you leniently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mitigating facts, that&#8217;s a pretty phrase. I like
it. I am also ready to go anywhere you please&mdash;gaol
if you like; and I can understand that you would
prefer me to be a little farther removed from the
Czar than we are at the present moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send you there under guard, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, decidedly no,&#8221; I said firmly. &#8220;If you send
me anywhere under guard, it will be to a prison, and
then&mdash;well, things will happen, and you&#8217;ll be sorry.
I am enjoying this interview, and am quite willing to
continue it where and when you please; but you are
vastly mistaken if you think that I am only bluffing
you now. I am really dangerous, Prince. You know
the jargon of poker&mdash;well, it&#8217;s up to you to see me&mdash;if
you think it safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently he did not, for after a second&#8217;s pause
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go together, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>And together we went accordingly.</p>

<p>I was well satisfied with the progress of things so
far. I had told him nothing yet; had merely hinted
at the power I held; and the hint had forced him to
yield. Nothing more was said until we reached his
apartment, and once there, he sat down to his desk,
while I threw myself into an easy lounge chair. It
was my cue to appear absolutely unconcerned, and I
played up to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>&#8220;Now, monsieur, for the reasons why I am not
to hand you over to the police at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke sternly and curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The main reason is the blunder of your men at
Kovna. They first let me through with things that
were of great importance, and then let me back again
to take ample measures for the safety of myself&mdash;and
others. I owe them an infinite obligation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find it better to drop this jesting tone
and speak plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I adapt my tone to suit your convenience?
You are presuming to address me as if I
were a prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why persist in this ridiculous delusion? I am
not anything like so near a gaol as&mdash;well, say as you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is insolence, monsieur,&#8221; he cried angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, calculated insolence, your Highness. I resent
your attitude. You have behaved infamously to
me&mdash;infamously. And you would carry your infamy
to the last extreme now, and send me to rot in one
of your gaols, were you not restrained by your fear
of the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not speak thus to me,&#8221; he cried passionately,
striking the desk with his fist.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall speak as I please to the man who laid a
treacherous trap to lure me to my death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not the way to obtain my leniency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn your leniency! Do what you dare&mdash;right
now. I am as safe from your threats as I am indifferent
to your anger. I am a free-speaking American
citizen, monsieur, not a Russian serf; and I can
prove my innocence as clearly as I can prove your
guilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tempt me to end the interview by your arrest.
Had you not been a friend of his Majesty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh from me cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. I understand. You mean it&#8217;s safer to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
hear me out, no matter what tone I adopt. And so
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew well enough I was dangerous to him;
and filling up a pause by drawing some large sheets
of official paper before him and selecting a pen, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your statement, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find it advisable to put it all down
there; but you can please yourself. First, we&#8217;ll clear
up the mystery of your prisoner. His name is&mdash;but
wait, here are some of his papers, including his passport.
I used that with his consent to pass your men
at Kovna;&#8221; and I handed over such of Siegel&#8217;s cards
and papers as I had with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You admit this?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>My action surprised him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. Fortunately I met him on the train, and
we arranged that I should use his passport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You conspired together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it how you like. It doesn&#8217;t matter five cents.
If I didn&#8217;t know that, I shouldn&#8217;t have told you.
Shall I wait while you write that down?&#8221; I asked,
for his paper was as blank as my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can trust my memory for his crime,&#8221; he replied
when I waited for an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can have my first condition. M. Siegel
must be liberated the moment he expresses the wish
to leave. I don&#8217;t want him to lose material for his
article. He was so useful to me, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince bit his lips savagely and sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good of you to name your conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t, how could you comply with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have some others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I have. The next is the immediate
release of Mademoiselle Helga Boreski&mdash;or Lavalski,
whichever name you prefer. When that trap of yours
for me failed&mdash;and only an accident caused the failure,
for it took me in completely; you may like to know
that&mdash;I went to the Mademoiselle and told her your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
intentions in regard to her, warned her and assisted
her in attempting to fly. Your quick swoop on the
place afterwards&mdash;a fact we had not counted on&mdash;broke
up our plans, and she was arrested. I tell you
of the mistakes we made in regard to you, so that you
may feel perfectly sure I have not made any miscalculations
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your own admission, you aided the escape
of this Nihilist leader. You are frank, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except that she is not a Nihilist leader, but your
personal enemy, you are quite right. I admit I helped
her to get away. I went with her, of course, as you
now know.&#8221;</p>

<p>My frankness was having precisely the effect upon
him which I calculated. He felt I should not make
a number of hazardous admissions if I had not some
strong cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must, of course, be held answerable for this;
even my desire to save you would be useless in the
face of this,&#8221; he said, for all the world as though he
were my best friend and protector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready right here and now. But about
Mademoiselle&#8217;s release?&#8221; I asked when he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is preposterous&mdash;monstrous&mdash;out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s got to be done; how, I leave to you;&#8221;
and I leant back and smoked placidly.</p>

<p>He sat thinking, and then shot the question at me
for which I had been waiting, and with it a sharp
lightning glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have those papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>I enjoyed the start and frown which the words
fetched, and his evident discomfiture and perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your men were very good to me; I should like
to recommend one of them in particular for promotion.&#8221;
I couldn&#8217;t resist the chance for this little
gird at him. &#8220;I had them on me when I passed the
barrier and again when I came back. And now they&#8217;re
in good safe keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>He bore the gibe without retort, without a sign of
any kind, although I knew how deep I had thrust
the blade in.</p>

<p>&#8220;A queer turn of the wheels, isn&#8217;t it? The very
papers you sent me out to recover, when I do recover
them, become my weapon against you. And, by the
way, they are not the only ones I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the full case&mdash;with dates, details, names
of witnesses, proofs, everything&mdash;in the charge
against you in that Lavalski matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw his hand tighten on the arm of his chair,
and a muttered oath slipped out from the pressed lips
in a whisper. Save for that one truant whisper, his
face was as pale and immobile as death itself.</p>

<p>The sight of his tense emotion satisfied even my
bitterness against him, and I held my tongue, speculating
what he would do.</p>

<p>He found the problem beyond even his ingenuity
for a time at least, and sat thinking, trying to see
a course that was not fraught with real danger. He
had guarded this secret jealously; fought for it with
desperate vigilance; flourished on it prosperously for
years until he had reached so high; and now exposure
menaced him with all its consequences of overthrow,
ruin and disgrace.</p>

<p>I knew he would fight on doggedly, if only he could
find the means of fighting. But where he would look
for them I could not see.</p>

<p>The silence lasted for minutes, and then he moved.
He had apparently thought the thing out and made
his choice. At length he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Lavalski charge is false, monsieur,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intentionally false, no,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Mademoiselle
Helga is incapable of deliberate falsehood.
Mistaken, possibly. The inquiry which his Majesty
will order on hearing the charge will no doubt settle
its truth or mistake. That is all that is needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty will order no inquiry, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>&#8220;We shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess Stephanie has seen his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning, in a long and painful interview.
I was present. What passed has convinced his Majesty
of the character of this mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the one thing I had feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe that of the Emperor,&#8221; I said
firmly. Our eyes met and I tried in vain to read the
expression in his.</p>

<p>&#8220;From that quarter the mademoiselle can look for
no countenance&mdash;now,&#8221; he returned, with slow incisive
significance.</p>

<p>I began to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have yet to see him and tell my story,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat, there can be no inquiry, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will arise out of any trial of the mademoiselle,&#8221;
I said significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There need be no trial.&#8221; He accompanied the
ambiguous sentence with a look which further enlightened
me. Helga must look to him and not to
the Czar for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It rests with you,&#8221; he answered, slowly, as if
the words were wrung from him by torture. As indeed
they had been.</p>

<p>I drew a long breath of relief. I had won, and the
intense significance of my victory rushed upon me,
filling me with a gladness that deprived me for the
moment of the power to speak.</p>

<p>I got up and walked two or three times across the
room. Helga was free, and I had freed her. The
luck was indeed with us. Looking at the Prince I
found his eyes riveted upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are satisfied, M. Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. What remains to be done can be arranged
easily. When can Mademoiselle Helga be set at
liberty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as she agrees to abandon this ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
charge against me, and arranges for the surrender of
the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>My face clouded. I had not thought of that. Helga
had to abandon everything&mdash;the very purpose of her
life. Would she?</p>

<p>&#8220;They cannot be surrendered until she is beyond
your reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not credit me with much good faith,&#8221; he
said bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you held my life in your hands would you put
the weapon into mine and expect me to kill myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you expect me to credit you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot help yourself. Besides, I have gone
straight. I am not a Russian diplomatist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me where those papers are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will I put my head in a noose and hand you the
loose end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know that you have them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you so. My word is enough; but you know
pretty well I shouldn&#8217;t have ventured here if I had
not had them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came expecting to see the Emperor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And should have forced my way to him just now&mdash;if
I hadn&#8217;t known that, having them, it was safe
to trust myself with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else knows where they are?&#8221;</p>

<p>I started and looked at him. I began to see his
drift, and led him on.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; I answered, and I saw by the way his
eyes fell that my new suspicions were correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give me a pledge on your honour that
if I do what you ask you will hand them to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he would not trust me to see his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Any pledge you like, written or verbal,&#8221;
I answered, helping him out. &#8220;But write me first
that you grant my conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I agree to that. It is fair.&#8221; And he began
to use for the first time the paper with which at the
start he had made so much show. &#8220;Will that suffice?&#8221;
he asked, handing me the writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>I appeared to read it carefully, but I was watching,
and noticed that iron-nerved as he was, his hands
were trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that will do,&#8221; I said, and put it away in my
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now write, then,&#8221; and we exchanged places, he
standing up by me, I sitting at his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see, how shall I word it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; he said, his voice trembling.
&#8220;Write where those papers are, or by God it will be
your last moment alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was turning to look at him when I felt the cold
circle or pistol barrel pressed to my head.</p>

<p>Move, I dared not, for I knew that at the least
sign of resistance from me he would fire. I saw how
he had reasoned. He believed that I alone knew
where the papers were, and that if he shot me the
secret would die with me. If I refused to write what
he demanded, he would kill me and take the risk of
their never being found; while if I did tell him, he
would kill me just the same and get the papers afterwards.</p>

<p>But my precautions spelt checkmate to his ingenious
scheme. Bitterly as he hated me, I knew he would not
indulge his hatred at the expense of his own inevitable
ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write something you had better read,&#8221; I
said steadily, and wrote: &#8220;I have placed the papers
where, if anything happens to me, the one set will
pass at once into the hands of the Embassy&#8221;&mdash;I
named the Power concerned&mdash;&#8220;and the other set
straight to the Czar.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ceased writing and felt the pressure of the barrel
increase as he bent forward to read the words. He
gave such a start that I wondered his fingers did not
pull the trigger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only testing you,&#8221; he said, then, and he
tossed the revolver back in the drawer from which
he had secretly taken it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>&#8220;Testing my folly, you mean, Prince Kalkov,&#8221; I
said as I rose. &#8220;Seeing whether I was fool enough
to put my finger in the cobra&#8217;s mouth without making
sure that the fangs were drawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry. I was not myself,&#8221; he said, his voice
strangely weak; and he fell into the lounge chair
where I had been sitting, and lay there ashen white
and trembling, so that I thought he would faint.</p>

<p>I could guess from that what he had undergone.</p>

<p>He was so long in this condition that I began to
think he was seriously ill, and would collapse altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I summon assistance for you, monsieur?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he murmured faintly, with a feeble wave
of his white hand.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before he could rally sufficiently
to resume.</p>

<p>Then he got up and changed to his own chair by
the desk. He was like a man more than half dead,
and when he tried to write, his hand shook so violently
that he could not form the letters.</p>

<p>I waited in silence and watched him. Unscrupulous,
treacherous, subtle, and vile as I believed him, he was
so broken and beaten that I could almost have found
it in me to pity him.</p>

<p>He succeeded after a strenuous effort in mastering
his feebleness sufficiently to be able to write.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall trust your honour, M. Denver. Here is an
order to admit you to Mademoiselle Boreski, and to
see her in private. Go to her at once. Bring me
word that she abandons this wrongful charge against
me, and you can both leave the country to-night. You
can then surrender the documents. You will understand
my wish for haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see M. Siegel also,&#8221; I said; &#8220;and have an
order for his release.&#8221;</p>

<p>With another effort he wrote me the necessary
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>&#8220;Now, excuse me, I am not well;&#8221; he sighed
heavily, and his head fell forward on his hands.
&#8220;Please ring that bell for me,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>I touched it and went out, leaving him still in that
pose of abject broken weakness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXVII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">A LAST MOVE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY interview had been so successful and the
Prince&#8217;s submission so complete that it never
occurred to me to look for still further treachery from
him.</p>

<p>I had carried everything before me so triumphantly;
had secured Helga&#8217;s freedom, and was on my way to
take her the good news; she and I would leave the
country; Siegel would be cleared from all trouble;
and on every point I had forced from the Prince just
those conditions which I chose to impose.</p>

<p>So overcome was my opponent, so prostrated, that
only with a great effort had he been able to keep up
to the end. And if I was inclined to be conceited
over my victory it must be remembered that I had
been pitted against a man of wide influence, drastic
power, and very high position.</p>

<p>It did occur to me, indeed, as I was driving to
the prison, that the Prince had not given me the order
for Helga&#8217;s release, and that he had worded his phrase
peculiarly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me her consent,&#8221; he had said; but this
appeared no more than the ordinary caution he would
employ, seeing that he was not likely to set her at
liberty without some such pledge. What he had really
had in mind, however, I was to learn later.</p>

<p>At the prison no hesitation was shown about complying
with his order. I was shown into a bare room
with a small table and a couple of chairs&mdash;a place
just one remove from an ordinary cell; and after I
had waited some few minutes Helga was brought
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>She was very pale, but a flush of surprise, and I
think delight, swept over her face at seeing me. She
just put her hands into mine as I stretched them out
to her and left them there while I gazed into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very pale, dearest,&#8221; I said at length. It
was the first time I had ever used such a term of
endearment, and her eyes and a smile noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad,&#8221; she answered, with sweet inconsequence.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t in the least know how you
have done it. It must be some new American method.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the American method,&#8221; I whispered, and
drew her to me till her face was close to mine, and
then I held her in a passionate embrace while I pressed
my lips to hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been so anxious for you,&#8221; she murmured,
putting her arms about my neck. &#8220;I did not care
for myself. I am so glad.&#8221; And then of her own
volition she kissed me again, and let her head fall
on my shoulder with a sigh.</p>

<p>For a while I had no need for words, and just
stood lost in the delight of her new tenderness and
witching mood of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;You caught me so weak,&#8221; she said at length,
&#8220;in the joy of seeing you safe. Now satisfy my
curiosity. I am only a woman, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come from Prince Kalkov to tell you you
are free, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of the name, she started and would
have drawn away from me had I let her.</p>

<p>&#8220;From him? But you have been a prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, never in any real danger of being one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are free now?&#8221; she cried, looking at me
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed then, and backed out of my arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my sympathy was wasted; and my
remorse&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a very sweet remorse, Helga,&#8221; I said,
as she left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>&#8220;I thought you had been arrested, and charged
with Vastic&#8217;s murder; that I had brought you to
ruin and shame. Oh, it was unendurable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you had known?&#8221; I asked, with a glance
she read. &#8220;Was it only remorse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One does strange things on&mdash;on impulse. I have
suffered so, and it was such a relief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gates of relief are still open,&#8221; and I spread
out my arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to see you,&#8221; she cried, with a flash of the
eyes and a blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I mean&mdash;to feel&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us be sensible and talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we have been very sensible without
talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will not let us be long together,&#8221; she continued,
ignoring my words and looks and sitting down.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will depend on you, Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On me? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have but to say one word, and we shall be
always together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another American method? They are very elastic,&#8221;
she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very thorough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you escape? Please tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I have come to do that. All is well now.
Siegel was caught at Kovna instead of me. I got
through with the papers, returned, put them in safe
keeping in the capital, tried to see the Emperor, and
saw Kalkov instead; and when he realized what had
happened, he agreed to release you, in order that you
and I might leave Russia together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bewilder me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give you the details;&#8221; and I told her at
some length all that had passed since we had parted in
the train.</p>

<p>The story did not produce the effect upon her I
wished. My note was one of jubilant congratulation;
but I saw a look of thoughtful doubt settle gradually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
upon her face, and it hardened when I spoke of Kalkov&#8217;s
condition that she should abandon her war against
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he tell you he had seen me? You have not
mentioned it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came here&mdash;here to this prison&mdash;to this very
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To threaten me first, and then to offer me your
and my liberty. He swore to me that you had been
arrested, and that all the papers had been found upon
you; that you were charged with Vastic&#8217;s murder, and
that he could secure your conviction&mdash;and then he
offered me liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On what condition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically the same as you have mentioned. You
have done well for me, my friend, but the Prince is
too tortuous for straight-minded men to deal with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to feel about as cheap as a five-cent piece.
He had failed with Helga, and then made a show of
submission to me in order to use me to influence her.
It was not a pleasant reflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so long as a breath remained in my body and
a pulse in my heart I would spend that breath and exhaust
the pulse to vindicate my father&#8217;s memory and
revenge him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no answer to make; and sat chewing the cud
of this new reverse. Helga saw how hard I was hit,
how keen my disappointment, and tried gently to soften
the blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;No honest man can deal with the Prince,&#8221; she said;
and added with a smile: &#8220;You have secured the papers
by a magnificent stroke and we shall win now. It was
for you I was troubled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good of you to soften the fall, but it hurts a
bit all the same.&#8221; My smile was a very rueful one.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
&#8220;If it was mere revenge I should urge you to give it
up; but it&#8217;s your father&#8217;s memory, and I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He strove hard. He seemed to know he could
make me feel more keenly striking at you than at me;
and when he said the papers were in his hands I was
very near despair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand. Well, we&#8217;ll see it through to
the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you,&#8221; she cried eagerly. &#8220;You must take no
part. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, meeting my look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; I said lightly. &#8220;It is I who have
the papers now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot speak nor think lightly of it where you
are concerned,&#8221; was her earnest reply. &#8220;You must
see the danger is real.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no more evidence than your presence here.
Yet <i>you</i> do not give in. If you are troubled for me,
do you think I am indifferent about you? Helga!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I don&#8217;t think that. Oh, you know,&#8221; and
she stretched out her hand to me. &#8220;But this purpose
is my life. It is greater than all else. Yes,&#8221; she cried
in answer to my look, &#8220;greater even than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am jealous of it, Helga; so jealous that
I will destroy it&mdash;or it shall destroy me. There is
nothing to me greater than my love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can never be,&#8221; she said slowly, shaking her
head sadly. &#8220;It would be cruel for me to give you
hope, much as I would wish&mdash;ah, God! how much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will find a way,&#8221; I declared firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one by which you can help.&#8221; She spoke
suddenly after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are free; use your freedom to get the papers
out of the country to a place of safety. Then from
that vantage ground you can help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ingenious,&#8221; I said with a smile. &#8220;You mean
I should be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I know you are safe I shall be happier. I told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
you once I was stronger when you were away. I
should be stronger now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not going. I will not leave you here.
The papers are absolutely safe in Marvyn&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not yet know the Prince. While the papers
are in Russia he will leave no stone unturned to find
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are not in Russia. Where the Stars and
Stripes fly over the Embassy it is American territory;
even he is powerless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will find a way. Even now I believe he has
some scheme. He may have sent you here in order to
search your room. He will have your movements
to-day traced, and find out where you have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. He will not get much satisfaction
at either Embassy. He can but prove the truth
of what I told him and feel the iron pressure all the
closer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can you do if you remain in Petersburg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered with a gesture that the place was a
prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near you, then. I cannot go away&mdash;unless we
go together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A kindness that is almost cruel,&#8221; she sighed, and
then a silence fell between us.</p>

<p>It was an <i>impasse</i>. The Prince was not likely to
let her get out of his grasp unless she promised to
forego her purpose; that was certain. Equally certain
it was in that she would not yield. I could not
ask her to abandon the work of clearing her father&#8217;s
memory. She had lived all her life for that one object;
and knowing her so well as I now did, I felt she
would cling to it to the end in the very face of death
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an almost hopeless outlook for you,&#8221; she
said, breaking the long silence and speaking my own
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>&#8220;But we have to find the way, and we shall;&#8221; and
then, as if in answer to my wish, a view of the matter
which had not struck me flashed upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have thought of something,&#8221; she said, reading
my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not please you. It is a compromise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A compromise? How? I see none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will put it. You have a double motive in
this fight with the Prince&mdash;to clear your father&#8217;s
memory, and to punish Kalkov. Let me see him and
tell him if he will right your father&#8217;s name you will
leave him alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him continue to prosper on his infamy? You
ask this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you cannot tear down the stones of this place,
will you help yourself by dashing your head against
the walls? As we stand, we are helpless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can punish him, and all Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that help in the really greater object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are tempting me to be untrue to my whole
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am showing you how possibly you may gain
your end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the proofs of his baseness will get to the
Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we hope. But even if they do, are you sure
of the Emperor? He told me that the Duchess Stephanie
had seen the Emperor and poisoned his ear
with the tale that you are a Nihilist. Do you think
Kalkov is not cunning enough to meet a charge from
such a source? It is not those papers the Prince fears,
it is the complication with the Powers. If you were
free to press your claim for justice, it might be otherwise:
but as we are, we are desperately weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like treachery to my father,&#8221; she said vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were so in reality I should not press it, Helga.
But I do;&#8221; and I went on to urge it, using every consideration
that occurred to me. Indeed the more I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
thought of it, the more was I convinced that it offered
the only solution to an impossible position.</p>

<p>That she should be anxious to punish the man who
had dealt so cruel a blow at her father, and was now
pursuing her so relentlessly was natural enough; in
truth I would have been glad to take a strong hand in
the work. But he was old and a year or two more of
unmerited honours for him weighed but little against
the disastrous consequences to both of us.</p>

<p>The one consideration that began to tell at last with
Helga, however, was the fact that her father&#8217;s reputation
might be righted if she gave in to me, and would
probably not be if she were to remain in prison or be
sent to Siberia.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he cannot do it,&#8221; she urged, when my insistence
upon this point began to influence her. &#8220;To right
my father is to prove the Prince&#8217;s wrong-doing. He
cannot do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there, let me try it. If he cannot we shall
be only where we stand now. I have sufficient faith
in his craftiness; but we shall still have our weapons
left to us. We may gain; we cannot lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brows drawn in deep thought and her face set,
she was considering her answer when the door was
opened, and we had a genuine surprise.</p>

<p>Prince Kalkov entered.</p>

<p>I stood up and stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This interview was to be private,&#8221; I said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to take part in it, monsieur. I have
something to say that will interest you both, and probably
affect your decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not welcome the intrusion,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have nothing to say to my gaoler,&#8221; said
Helga.</p>

<p>I thrust one of the two chairs over to him, and
pulling the small table towards me, sat down on it
between him and Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;You omitted to tell me to-day that you had
already seen mademoiselle, and that she had refused
your offer.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>&#8220;It was not necessary&mdash;then. Now, however, it
is different. I will be frank with you. I sent you
here that I might have your rooms at the hotel
searched, and your movements to-day ascertained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, knowing you, had already told me
that was probably your object. I assured her that
you would gain nothing, unless you called at a certain
Embassy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you were right, monsieur,&#8221; he answered,
quite unmoved. &#8220;I admit your caution and admire
it. It has confirmed my opinion of your strength in
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I said to you before, I repeat now&mdash;those
papers must be returned to my hands, at any cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two sets of papers,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those affecting me you can retain. I can protect
myself from any charges and slanders founded upon
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistake!&#8221; exclaimed Helga bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said mistake, mademoiselle; and I am going to
prove to you before I leave that what I say is true.
But first, you are here together, and I invite you to
say on what terms the other papers shall be placed in
my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had my answer to-day,&#8221; said Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not accept that answer, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here in no spirit of hostility, neither to make
or to hear recriminations. I wish the important papers
to be recovered with the least disturbance and trouble
to all concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a threat,&#8221; I put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not so intended, M. Denver. You have acted
cleverly, but you have not exhausted the resources at
my command. If no terms are made now, it will leave
me no option but to have you arrested, charged with
treason and conspiracy in regard to these papers, and
then I can use my influence with your Ambassador to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
secure that the papers lodged with Mr. Marvyn shall
be held inviolate and then returned eventually to me.
It is for you to make your choice, whether to stand by
mademoiselle&#8217;s answer or to make better terms with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a fresh turn indeed, and when I glanced
at Helga I saw she had turned pale, and that, like
myself, she was at loss how to parry it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXVIII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">LOVE WILL HAVE
ITS WAY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PRINCE KALKOV was an opponent with whom
it was dangerous to hesitate and fatal to appear
disconcerted, so I shook myself up as quickly as I
could, and answered with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very plausible story, your Highness, but
if you can do all this, why are you here? It&#8217;s not for
your health, is it; or from any newly-born affection
or solicitude for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have made no such pretence,&#8221; he said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it will be less troublesome to recover the
papers directly through you than indirectly from Mr.
Marvyn. I merely wish you to see that they will be
recovered, one way or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think you&#8217;d better go to work indirectly,
Prince,&#8221; I said in a very deliberate tone. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t
accept implicitly the explanation you&#8217;ve just given
me, don&#8217;t blame me. You must set it down against
that knack of yours to say one thing and mean another.
Yes, I think on the whole it had better be indirectly.
I see a little flaw in your plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had we not better avoid personalities and insults,
M. Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean about your little knacks. Is that an
insult? I thought it was a canon of European diplomacy
according to Talleyrand&mdash;that language is
given us to conceal our thoughts. I meant it as an
explanation, not an insult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You prefer to meet these charges?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes. I don&#8217;t see any difficulty in them. As
for the murder charge, I happen to have at command
the evidence of the man who was with Vastic at the
time, and he can prove I acted in self-defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The testimony of a fugitive Nihilist,&#8221; he rapped
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but still testimony; and as I&#8217;m an American,
it will have to be a fair and open trial. There
is also Mademoiselle Helga&#8217;s evidence. Yes, on the
whole, I&#8217;m disposed to take that risk. As to the
treason business, do you really think you&#8217;d better
prove that? It was your idea that I should play the
part of Emperor, and you furnished me with forged
documents and other lies to get those papers back;
and as you&#8217;re making it an international matter, it
would make rather an awkward story. Still, do as
you like. But you haven&#8217;t frightened me. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s a bullet in the cartridge. Go right ahead
anyway, pull the trigger, and we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do what I have said, nevertheless, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly you think so&mdash;possibly, I say. But I
don&#8217;t agree with you. You see, my father is not only
a rich man, but has a heap of influence at the White
House. If I remember, too, he has a bit of a grievance
against Russia; and he&#8217;d make things hum a lot
if you monkey with me. I hadn&#8217;t thought of bringing
him into it, but I believe it would be the best thing.
Helga and I were trying to think of the best way out
when you came, and I&#8217;m hanged if I don&#8217;t think
you&#8217;ve given me just the cue I wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, perhaps, he could save the mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing at a time, and for the moment we&#8217;re
talking about my case. Yes&mdash;&#8221; I spoke with intentional
slowness, as if thinking it out&mdash;&#8220;yes, I
shall cable him to hurry over. I wonder I never
thought of it. If I can&#8217;t get to the Emperor, he can,
right away; and if he don&#8217;t make it an international
affair inside two shakes, then I don&#8217;t know my own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
father. That treason charge was just a lovely thought
of yours, Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince rose. I had turned the tables on him
at his own bluff, but like a good player he kept his
end up.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not allow prisoners to have the use of our
telegraphs, monsieur,&#8221; he said nastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Embassy can send it in cypher. Same thing,&#8221;
I replied unconcerned. &#8220;The worse you make things
for me, the bigger the fuss when it does get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned from me to Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go back to your cell, and you and M.
Denver will not meet again, mademoiselle,&#8221; he declared,
like the bully he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite ready,&#8221; she answered, not flinching a
hair&#8217;s breadth; &#8220;now that I have heard what is to
happen;&#8221; and she rose and met his look steadily.</p>

<p>And we stood thus a space in silence. Both sides
recognized that the situation was just bluff. I had
shown him the rottenness of his position; and he knew
that, despite my easy words, I was anxious to get the
thing arranged without any of the trouble I had outlined.
And yet neither was willing to take the first
step down.</p>

<p>Then I offered him a bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this worth while, Prince?&#8221; I asked very quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have shown you my hand, and you can see it&#8217;s
a strong one. Why not take the card you&#8217;ve been
keeping up your sleeve. You have one, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you are willing to submit to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve shown you I can set
you at defiance and face the worst you can do, with
absolute confidence that I shall win. But I&#8217;m willing
to listen to what you came to say. You haven&#8217;t given
us the proof that Helga&#8217;s charge against you in regard
to her father is mistaken. What&#8217;s the proof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can prove it by the man most concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga went white to the lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>&#8220;Name,&#8221; I asked curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By her own father&mdash;Prince Lavalski. He is still
living&mdash;in Siberia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, my poor father!&#8221; cried Helga, falling
into a chair and covering her face with her hands. I
crossed and laid my hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage, Helga, courage. This may be good
news, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not good news, monsieur, but the worst for
his daughter,&#8221; continued the Prince, relentlessly. &#8220;You
have forced me to tell you. His life was spared against
his wish when his offences were proved; and it is by
his own desire that he has remained in Siberia, dead to
all who knew him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie, a base lie, a lie of lies,&#8221; cried Helga,
with sudden passion. &#8220;He is dead, and you&mdash;you,
Prince Kalkov, are his murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ungenerous, even for an enemy, mademoiselle,&#8221;
replied the Prince, with a bow that was not
without courtesy and dignity. &#8220;Had you come to me
openly years ago, I would have told you the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is false, and you know it. You tried to wreak
your malevolence on me. You know I speak the truth,
just as you know you were afraid I should tear the
mask from your life and ruin you in the eyes of your
Emperor. How can you be so base?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The full truth of your father&#8217;s offences was and is
known to but two men in the Empire, mademoiselle.
The Emperor himself is one, and I am the other. I
had and have nothing to fear from any disclosure or
inquiry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God, that such villainy should prosper!&#8221; she cried
again, with passionate vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I have told you is the truth, and I offer you
the means to prove my words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What means?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not dishonour my father by even listening
further,&#8221; exclaimed Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Helga can communicate with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
father, or you, monsieur, can go to him,&#8221; said Kalkov,
disregarding her protest, and turning to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said scornfully. &#8220;And you would get
one of your pliant tools to answer my letters or personate
my dead father. I know you and your methods
too well, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand your anger, mademoiselle, and pass
over your taunts. I have offered you the proof I
promised. I have now said my last word, monsieur,&#8221;
he added, turning to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I bring the Prince back with me?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, if he will come. But he will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, for then I should see the deception,&#8221; said
Helga, with scorn; and then with a change to eagerness,
&#8220;Can I go to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are limits to my powers. I cannot send
armed escorts to Siberia and back to satisfy the doubts
of all our prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go alone,&#8221; declared Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;And return&mdash;here?&#8221; with a significant lift of the
eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I would break my pledged word?&#8221;
asked Helga indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt you would endeavour to keep it.
But it is a risk I should not feel entitled to take. I
repeat I cannot provide an escort for any prisoner for
such a distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would escort her,&#8221; I broke in quickly.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at me coldly and steadily, as
he replied deliberately:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not her husband yet, monsieur. And if
you were,&#8221; he added, after pausing, &#8220;what greater
security should I have for her return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want no more than these papers, I suppose,
if she did not return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she can persuade her father to return, that will
be better still. We are ready to bury the past.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>&#8220;Your objection then is not to mademoiselle&#8217;s going
to find him, but only lest, having found him, she should
still use these documents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have stated it precisely. We must be absolutely
secured on that point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me to find the way then. Give me an
hour and either return here or I will see you at the
palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will return,&#8221; he said drily; &#8220;for if you do not
decide I shall take the other course.&#8221; With that threat
he went away.</p>

<p>It was a curious situation that he left behind him.
Helga had not said a word since his pointed sentence
in reply to my offer to take her to her father, and I
could not of course guess what she thought. But I
knew my own mind very clearly; and that is always
a circumstance in a two-sided discussion. At the same
time I was not a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>Helga was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be true, do you think? Or is it only another
of his schemes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It differs a good deal from any others&mdash;at least
in one point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. I won&#8217;t. I am sure it is false.
My father was the soul of honour and loyalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would at any rate see him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my God, what would I not do to see him,&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>But I wished to get her away from this strenuous
mood, so I said with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Even comply with his suggested condition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not thinking of that. How can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a long honeymoon trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head as if my tone jarred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see all it means to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what it means to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she exclaimed, impatiently. &#8220;Be serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve been serious long enough. Believe
me, I know all that this portentous news must be to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
you. Pray God it is true that your father is alive.
But there are some anxieties we can face better with a
bright face. So smile to me, and say you&#8217;ll go with
me to find and bring him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>I held out my hands.</p>

<p>She hung back a moment with head averted and
then turned and put her hands in mine, her face smiling
and her eyes dashed with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all so strange,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We Americans are never sticklers for forms.
We&#8217;ll go with a laugh, dear, whatever we are destined
to find there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so good and so strong,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am just discovering how much better and
stronger I shall be with&mdash;with my wife, Helga,&#8221; I
whispered back.</p>

<p>She came to me then, with a sigh and a laugh and
lots of blushes which she hid on my shoulder from
my eyes as well as from the musty dingy old prison
walls. Musty and dingy? Well, no. They will never
be that in my memory. For the sake of that minute
they will always have a halo in my thoughts; for after
all it was the prison which did so much to hasten our
happiness.</p>

<p>And so it was settled, and for the time we just lost
ourselves and babbled and laughed and sighed and
held hands and kissed and laughed again; for love
will have his way even in a prison with all sorts of
vague troubles gibbering and pranking from the other
side of the bars.</p>

<p>And when I glanced at my watch I found we had
used up the whole hour save some ten minutes.</p>

<p>The problem which the Prince had left us was a
big one to solve in ten minutes; but we only smiled
at it, for Helga had come round to my view&mdash;to meet
everything with a laugh. And in that spirit we faced
the prospect of the long journey to Siberia.</p>

<p>When the Prince came back I had no formal answer
ready for him, of course. Helga was to be my wife;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and I could not get any further than that. I was certainly
in no fit mood to cope with him.</p>

<p>I suppose he saw the chaotic state of my mind; he
must have been very blind if he did not; for the
thought of Helga as my wife got in my way and
tripped me up every moment, so that my answers to
his first questions were given almost at random.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my word of honour that the moment
we find matters are as you say in regard to Prince
Lavalski in Siberia, the whole of these papers will be
returned to you. I suppose that will satisfy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A personal guarantee is at best unsubstantial,&#8221; he
returned rudely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it seem so to a Russian? It is not to an
American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no choice, it seems. When will you start?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as we are married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That can be at once&mdash;to-night or to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; exclaimed Helga, in dismay at the
suddenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we must wait till then if we can&#8217;t manage
it to-night,&#8221; I said; and she laughed to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be an elaborate ceremony,&#8221; said the
Prince drily. &#8220;A prison does not lend itself to scenic
effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A prison,&#8221; said I, surprised in my turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle can only leave here as your wife,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think we&#8217;ll try and manage it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, to-morrow,&#8221; declared Helga, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better to-night; we can spend to-morrow in
the preparations for the long journey,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;One can&#8217;t go to Siberia without clothes; even on
a honeymoon, you see. We could start on the following
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; her face was wrinkled in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;No &#8216;buts,&#8217; only smiles, Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give the necessary instructions,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Prince, perceiving like the shrewd old man he was that
I should carry the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have witnesses. Mr. Siegel will be one
of them,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the order for his release,&#8221; replied the
Prince. &#8220;I will wait for you, monsieur,&#8221; he added,
and very considerately took himself off.</p>

<p>He had to wait, for Helga still had scruples which
I had to combat. And before I had overcome them
his patience was exhausted, and he sent a messenger
in quest of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God you&#8217;ll be out of here in an hour or
two, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped the protest on her lips. Any lover knows
how that has to be done. She laughed at my
eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, sweetheart. We&#8217;ll meet it all with a laugh
as we agreed;&#8221; and not keeping the Prince waiting
more than another quarter of an hour, I left her happy,
blushing, loving&mdash;and resigned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have appointed ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said as I joined
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; I should have said &#8220;very well&#8221; if
he had named midnight or four in the morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to understand that I shall do all I can
to help you&mdash;now,&#8221; he said pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right.&#8221; My head was still in the clouds.
In an hour or so Helga would be my wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall wish to know where you will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless my soul, I hadn&#8217;t thought about that,&#8221;
I exclaimed. &#8220;We shall stay at the Imperial. Oh,
and I&#8217;ve no clothes. They are at the Palace. You
see it&#8217;s a little sudden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My man, Pierre, is at your service, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d let him get them to the Imperial; or
shall I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see to it. There is one thing, of course,
M. Denver. You will make no attempt to see his
Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only got an hour and a half.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to-morrow, of course,&#8221; he exclaimed,
testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;d better not, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, I shall have your route carefully prepared,
with full instructions to all on the way to help
you forward with all speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you&#8217;re as anxious as I am to get
the thing ended and done with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find I can be as firm a friend as I can
be a resolute enemy. I wish to be your friend, monsieur,
for my august master&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done pretty well as an enemy, Prince;
let&#8217;s hope the future will show us the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then for the present, good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the present?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall of course be at the ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want him there; but as I would rather be
married to Helga in his presence than not married to
her at all, I said nothing. Besides, I was not in a
critical mood.</p>

<p>I was sufficiently practical to remember to go to
the hotel and engage rooms, and on the way I stopped
at a jeweller&#8217;s store and bought a ring. And having
done that I hunted up Harold Marvyn and induced
him to consent to be at the wedding.</p>

<p>Then I drove to the prison where Frank Siegel was
confined. I produced the order for his release, arranged
all the preliminaries, and then told them to
show me straight to the prisoner, as I wished to take
the news to him myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, what in thunder brings you here?&#8221; he exclaimed,
as I entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought the order for your release, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face fell, and he looked the reverse of pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re just monkeying. I don&#8217;t want any
release,&#8221; he said in a tone of such irritation that I
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but you&#8217;ve got to come. I&#8217;m going to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
married in about half an hour, and I want you to be
best man.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took it so coolly that I could have kicked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course that makes a difference. But it strikes
me you&#8217;re using me some, Harper. Who&#8217;s the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know. Met her in the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the Nihilist. Sounds all right. Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee; that&#8217;ll make good copy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that seemed its best recommendation in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take it very lightly,&#8221; I said, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, it&#8217;s your marriage, not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that we left the cell.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIX</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">A LAST PRECAUTION</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a quaint ceremony, our marriage.</p>

<p>The clock was close on the stroke of ten when
Siegel and I reached the prison where Marvyn was
already waiting for us in the room in which Helga
and I had seen each other. He shook hands with
Siegel and congratulated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;On getting in or getting out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both,&#8221; replied Marvyn, and they laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a queer show,&#8221; said Siegel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denver was never conventional,&#8221; returned Marvyn
with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do they tie them up over here? Greek
Church?&#8221; queried Siegel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Marvyn. &#8220;Depends on the religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through soon?&#8221; and Siegel glanced at his watch.
&#8220;I want a bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few minutes. By the way, Denver, to make
the thing regular&mdash;I thought I&#8217;d better ask Hoskyns,
the Embassy chaplain, to come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I hadn&#8217;t thought of that,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to the chapel, monsieur?&#8221; asked a
warder entering at that moment.</p>

<p>He led us through the corridors to the dimly-lighted
gloomy chapel where Helga in charge of a female
warder was waiting near the chaplain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd looking Joshua,&#8221; murmured Siegel, glancing
at the priest&#8217;s quaint robes.</p>

<p>Marvyn, who did things with official decorum, took
no notice and when we reached the altar rails Siegel
and Helga shook hands and he said something which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
made her smile. Then I introduced Marvyn who was
obviously struck by her beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very lovely,&#8221; he whispered to me as we took
our places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;ll make &#8217;em hustle around in New York,&#8221;
added Siegel who overheard him.</p>

<p>The ceremony was in Russian and very brief. The
priest spoke in a kind of droning chant and his deep
voice rolled around the empty building and came back
from the dark recesses behind the heavy pillars with a
hollow echo more striking than cheerful.</p>

<p>I knew enough of the ritual to do the right thing
at the right moment and when it all came to a rather
abrupt and unexpected end, I heard Siegel, whose
modernity was quite unaffected by the weird strangeness
of the scene, exclaim in a quite audible tone,
&#8220;First Half,&#8221; as if it had been a football match.</p>

<p>Marvyn saw to the completion of the legal formalities
and then Helga slipped her hand in my arm and
I led her away down the cold gaunt aisle.</p>

<p>I was too happy and proud to think of anything
except my dear beautiful wife until on passing one of
the plain sturdy pillars I felt her start, and glancing
round saw Prince Kalkov step from its shadow. He
did not speak to us, but joined the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he would be present; I had forgotten,&#8221; I
whispered to Helga. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why he has hurried us so,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We shall soon know.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we reached the little room we found Mr.
Hoskyns, the American chaplain, waiting for us, and
Marvyn who came in alone introduced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Siegel?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trying to interview Prince Kalkov,&#8221; he replied
with a dry smile.</p>

<p>Siegel came in time for the second ceremony which
was even shorter than that in the chapel, and when
the signing was finished and the others had congratulated
us, Helga got ready to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>&#8220;That should be a good double knot,&#8221; said Siegel.
&#8220;Do you suppose I can go back to my cell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve engaged a room for you at the Imperial,&#8221; I
told him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll all come round with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the chaplain excused himself and Marvyn
pleaded a pressing engagement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to come, Denver,&#8221; he said, drawing
me aside. &#8220;I want a word with you very particularly.
Come and see me first thing in the morning
at the Embassy, will you? It&#8217;s about those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to take them away. And as you&#8217;re
all right now, I suppose it won&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to do with Kalkov?&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indirectly, I&#8217;ll tell you in the morning. You
needn&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he added, noticing my look.</p>

<p>I promised to see him in the morning, and then
Siegel, declaring he must have a word or two with
Marvyn, persisted in going away with him.</p>

<p>I led Helga to the carriage and Prince Kalkov met
us by the door of the prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see you to-morrow, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, assuredly. We shall be at the Imperial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come to you there in the afternoon at
three o&#8217;clock. May I wish your wife and you all
happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga said nothing; she would not even look at
him, and I felt the pressure of her hand on my arm
tighten.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to have it, Prince. We have had to
fight hard to get even thus far,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bared his head and bowed to Helga, and with a
smile drew aside for us to pass.</p>

<p>Helga shivered slightly and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very foolish; but I am still afraid of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something to know he fears us also,&#8221; I answered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
&#8220;We have forced him to open these gates
for you and you are now the wife of an American
citizen. So we have the laugh on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a time,&#8221; she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, for <i>all</i> our time. The Stars and Stripes will
see to that. Besides, you agreed to meet even our
marriage with a laugh;&#8221; and then we began to keep
the agreement and to put the Prince and all his wiles
out of our thoughts.</p>

<p>At breakfast on the following morning Helga was
in excellent spirits as we discussed the prospects of
our long journey and planned the day&#8217;s work of preparation
for it. There were a hundred things to do and
innumerable purchases to make, and Helga with paper
and pencil laughed gaily as the list she made grew until
its length was formidable.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one nut we have still to crack,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;What to do with the papers,&#8221; and I told her what
Marvyn had said to me on the previous night. I had
not told her before not wishing to kindle her inflammable
anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince&#8217;s hand is in it, of course, and not for
any good,&#8221; was her comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best of dealing with such a man&mdash;you
can always gamble on it that he means some kind of
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we may tear this up,&#8221; she said, and held
up the list we had made so carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tear it up? But you&mdash;oh, you think we shan&#8217;t
be allowed to go, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I think, but I am sure there is
treachery somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was not in a suspicious mood, however. The world
had become very bright to me and I thought Helga
was too much under the influence of her former feelings.
One can&#8217;t shake oneself free in a dozen hours
from the trammels of such a life of danger and vigilance
as she had lived for years. She seemed to read
my thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>&#8220;You think I am fanciful, Harper,&#8221; she said with
a smile. &#8220;I hope so; but the Prince does nothing
without an object and his real object is so rarely that
which he lets you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am more confident than ever,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably he is reckoning on that, dear&mdash;to recover
the papers, hoping we shall make some false
step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused, for it had not dawned upon me until then
all that the abandonment of the journey might mean to
Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been very thoughtless, my dear, but I see
now what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled gently and sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost hope he is not alive. He was incapable of
any such crimes as the Prince hinted, and if he has
had to endure the life in the mines for all these years,
it would be worse than death to him. Better death
than a broken heart such as his would be. You would
say so if you had known him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were it my own father&#8217;s case I would rather he
were dead, Helga. I know the pain of such a thought
to you. The cruelty of Kalkov in raising a false hope
is just dastardly, and to do it for some fresh crafty
purpose makes it diabolical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What we have to do is to thwart the purpose; for,
depend on it, we are in as great danger from him as
ever. I think I begin to see it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows that the papers will be in either your
hands or mine and accordingly has hurried our
marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll blame him for that,&#8221; I interposed,
and drew a glance of love from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he put out the bait for this long journey for
us together&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he first opposed your going and wanted me
to go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>&#8220;Yes, knowing it would be useless for you to go by
yourself. He was merely working round to his end.
He can of course deal more easily with us together.
Then, see his next step. He waits until we are married
and pledged to go to Siberia, and then contrives
that the papers are to be suddenly forced back into
our possession. Mr. Marvyn is to give them to you
this morning, we are to start to-night or to-morrow;
and he reckons he can watch us so closely after you
get them and until we start that he will learn what
you do with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to take them with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga thought a moment and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely he has meant that too, but I doubt if
he would take such a risk. If I read him aright, he
will look for his opportunity at the first convenient
moment after you leave the Embassy this morning.
You will have the papers with you and an arrest and
a search would give him all he wants. You see it
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And see also that if it had not been for your
sharp woman&#8217;s wit I should have tumbled into his
trap again. You are wonderful, Helga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing wonderful in such a guess. I
know him. The question is what to do with the
papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They shall go to New York,&#8221; I said promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>As if to suggest an answer to her question Frank
Siegel came hurrying into the room saying as he shook
hands&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can give you just five minutes; been cabled for,
and am off for home in an hour. Going to join our
people in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga and I exchanged looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving &#8217;Frisco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;Same people, same papers,
different place, that&#8217;s all, except that it&#8217;s better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. Hope we shall follow you soon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>&#8220;Siberia off then?&#8221; he asked, in a matter of fact
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know yet. By the way, could you take
something to my father for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very quick, M. Siegel,&#8221; laughed Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mrs. Denver, I&#8217;d do anything in the
world to oblige you; but this is a large order. Can&#8217;t
risk another arrest just now. What&#8217;s up, Harper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want those papers got safely to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do better than take &#8217;em; tell you how to get
&#8217;em over safely. They wouldn&#8217;t be safe with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, get Marvyn to send &#8217;em as Embassy business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott, I never thought of it,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Mrs. Denver. You&#8217;ll like New York,
and we shall have times together. Better than Siberia.
Good-bye, Harper. Thanks for that chance in the
prison. Glad now I got out so soon. This cable&#8217;s
urgent. Good-bye and good luck,&#8221; and he was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;American methods are a little breathless, Harper,&#8221;
said Helga, with a laugh. &#8220;Do you all cut knots as
easily?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s cut this one anyway,&#8221; and then we discussed
how I should proceed. We decided to act just as
though we were really going away, and to make a
show of preparing for the journey. And at Helga&#8217;s
suggestion we put up a little scheme of our own to
frustrate any plan which the Prince might have
formed.</p>

<p>Helga was to go to see after her own matters and
we decided not to meet until an hour before the time
Prince Kalkov had appointed to call. Then we were
to lunch in our own rooms and not leave them until
he arrived.</p>

<p>The reason for this was of course that his spies
might be able to trace our movements very easily, and
lead the Prince to believe that what he sought would
be found with us in the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>I was to call first at the Foreign Embassy to arrange
matters there; then to see Marvyn, and on leaving
him to drive round to various stores to purchase what
I needed for the journey, and to do everything as
though I had not a suspicion of treachery.</p>

<p>I was on the point of starting when it occurred to
me that Marvyn might prove very reluctant to adopt
Siegel&#8217;s suggestion. In his official capacity he might
be placed in a very awkward and embarrassing position,
and would very probably shrink from having any
more official dealings with documents about which these
representations had been made.</p>

<p>I had no desire to get him into trouble and I therefore
resolved to mislead him. Accordingly I made up
a dummy set of papers closely resembling those I had
left with him, and I took them with me in readiness.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a very fortunate precaution.</p>

<p>Before anything was said on the subject I opened
my fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;This jaunt to Siberia is a pretty big thing, Marvyn,
and as one never knows what is going to happen I
think I ought to send some papers I have with me
home to my father: my will and some other things.
They are very important&mdash;some of them, and as my
relations with the authorities here have been peculiar,
and letters have a knack of getting opened, I want you
to send them over under official cover. I suppose
there&#8217;ll be no difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean the&mdash;those I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean these,&#8221; I said, and took them out of my
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be all right,&#8221; he answered in a tone
of relief, and held out his hand for them. &#8220;They
can go at once if you like. It happens we&#8217;re sending
off a special despatch to Washington about the China
crisis. We&#8217;ve had a messenger out with important
despatches from the President, and he&#8217;s going back
with our reply to-day. Give them to me and I&#8217;ll see
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>&#8220;I have a line or two to add to my father first.
And now about the important papers. I want you
to keep them till I get back from this journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, Denver. As I told you, I&#8217;d do
anything in my power for you, but this is really impossible.
Exactly what has happened I don&#8217;t know
and was told not to ask, but I have to give my word
that I&#8217;ve returned the things to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I assumed a little indignation of course and argued
the point, urging my father&#8217;s position and the extreme
inconvenience to me in having to take such
documents to Siberia, and then very reluctantly gave
way and took the packets from him.</p>

<p>He left me then to finish the supposed letter to my
father and all I had to do was to change the envelopes
and I slipped the dummies into envelopes I had brought
with me, endorsed precisely like the genuine ones, and
I put the genuine ones into an envelope addressed to
my father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could have sent these as well,&#8221; I said,
in a rueful tone to Marvyn when he brought me an
official wrapping; and I pointed to the two carefully
addressed dummies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could, but you&#8217;ll understand how it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very awkward,&#8221; I replied, and put them in
my pocket. &#8220;By the way, things being as they are,
it&#8217;s not worth while to speak of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Denver, silence is the very A.B.C. of
our work,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to do, and after a word or
two about our journey I pleaded the many preparations
I had to make, thanked him for all he had done
and bade him good-bye.</p>

<p>As I left the building I looked round for the Prince&#8217;s
agents, speculating when the arrest which Helga had
prophesied would be made.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXX</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE PRINCE
OUTWITTED</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IF Helga was right, I might expect to be stopped
very soon, and I was rather surprised that I
was allowed even to reach the carriage without
interruption.</p>

<p>Had Prince Kalkov taken that prompt step, he
might or might not have been able to intercept the
papers after finding they were not on me, but certainly
things would have gone very differently.</p>

<p>If the Prince did not discover the trick of the dummies
until the Embassy messenger had left Petersburg,
the chances in my favour would be vastly
increased.</p>

<p>To my surprise no attempt at all was made to interfere
with me. I presume I was closely watched,
but it was done so cleverly that I saw no signs of it.
It was not my cue to show any anxiety about it, and
I drove from store to store making a few purchases
and many inquiries, until the time came for me to
return to the hotel to Helga. She was surprised to
see me. Over lunch I told her my news, and we
discussed the position.</p>

<p>&#8220;He feels so sure, Harper, that he has put it off.
But it will come before the day is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers are well away by this time,&#8221; I laughed,
&#8220;so he can do his worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means to. I have seen M. Boreski. He had
heard of my arrest and release, and he came to my
house when I was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he was out of Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>&#8220;The Duchess Stephanie has patched everything up
with her family. So he told me. He is to get back
his Polish title, with a pardon for his old conspiracy,
and compensation for his lost estates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be glad that she is married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is they are rather afraid of what she
might do next. It was a strange meeting;&#8221; and she
smiled. &#8220;He is not really a strong man: I mean he
likes some one to lean on. He seemed afraid lest the
fact of his coming to me should be known, and yet
felt bound to come to warn me. He is very conscious
of his new dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To warn you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, about this journey to Siberia. The Duchess
had heard of it and told him&mdash;she must be in close
consultation with Kalkov after all; probably working
hand and glove with him to recover the papers. The
intention is that I shall be kept there as a prisoner&mdash;if
we ever reach there, that is. M. Boreski warned me
strongly against going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he know anything about your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; on that point the Prince appears to have kept
absolute secrecy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all seems to fit in. It will be interesting to see
what he does next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen some one else who is most anxious
to see you,&#8221; said Helga with a bright smile. &#8220;A
most earnest admirer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will be another American citizen, I think, but first
wishes to go to Siberia with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy to guess, Helga. He is a good fellow.
You mean Ivan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;He used to be devoted to
me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you tell him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; This with an air of supreme
innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;re no longer alone, and that his devotion
has now to be divided?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>&#8220;Yes; and actually he wasn&#8217;t surprised; but, oh,
so ridiculously pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ridiculously?&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered with a glance and a smile, and then
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is the most faithful servant that ever
lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find his equal in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a wonderful country your America is!&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll say that in earnest when you&#8217;ve been there
a while;&#8221; and with this mixture of banter and gravity
we covered our real anxieties while we waited for
Prince Kalkov to come.</p>

<p>He was punctual. The clock was on the stroke of
three when he was announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to the moment, Prince,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said three o&#8217;clock, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not looking well.&#8221;</p>

<p>In truth, he was looking very ill. His face was
drawn and careworn and absolutely colourless, his
eyes tired, and his whole expression suggestive of a
strained effort to rally an already overtaxed strength.
The events of the previous day had shaken him severely;
and I remembered his illness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an old man, monsieur, and not well. My
heart is treacherous,&#8221; he said as he sank into a chair.</p>

<p>It was not exactly a happy phrase, and I caught
Helga&#8217;s fleeting glance of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;A treacherous heart is an ugly life companion,&#8221;
I answered gravely. &#8220;May I suggest a glass of
cognac? You have been overtaxing your strength,
Prince,&#8221; I said as I handed it to him.</p>

<p>It seemed to give him some energy, and as he put
down the glass, he said in a less weary tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are packing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a lot to do, of course. You have brought
the papers and so on for our journey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>The monosyllable was more like his old sharp abrupt
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Oh well, we can wait a day longer if you
prefer it,&#8221; I answered with a sort of indulgent indifference.
&#8220;When one is ill, of course, the preparation
of such things is troublesome. When may we expect
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had news that alters the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed. Not bad news for us, I trust.&#8221; This with
quick anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that Prince Lavalski is dead, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; cried Helga, and turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did he die?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know.&#8221; It was a very lame story, and
I think he felt it, although he did his best to make it
impressive. &#8220;It has greatly disturbed me. I ought
to have been informed of it at the time, but it has
been left to reach me after long delay through official
reports.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this from me we were all silent for a time,
and Helga went through to the adjoining room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is tragic that you did not know this yesterday,
Prince,&#8221; I added at length. &#8220;To have roused my wife&#8217;s
hope only to kill it to-day is to inflict a very cruel
blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do now, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find it impossible to answer off hand. Of course
this proposed journey will now be useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; he declared bluntly. &#8220;That is why I
brought nothing with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I threw up my hands as if the situation baffled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Helga!&#8221; I sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go to your own country, monsieur?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can induce my wife to go, yes. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
I paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do most wisely to go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>&#8220;No doubt. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and I pulled up again as
if in the most desperate perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have paused twice on that word, monsieur,&#8221;
he exclaimed irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see this news puts us back to where we were
before, and my wife is still resolved to clear her father&#8217;s
memory. And so am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do most wisely if you go, I repeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think she will go until that is done. I
should not, and I should not counsel her to do so,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not accustomed to speak without full meaning,
monsieur, and again I advise you to leave Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we do not take the advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer was a gesture from which I might
deduce what I pleased. It was all very subtly and
cleverly acted; as cleverly as if the situation had
arisen quite unexpectedly.</p>

<p>He had so man&#339;uvred that the papers were, as he
believed, now within his reach. He felt that he could
compel us to give them up or have them taken from
us, and then deal with us as he pleased. He was probably
calculating that I must be discussing the new
situation embarrassed by a knowledge of this power
of his; and I therefore began to manifest some slight
uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to be your friend,&#8221; he said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of that. You have given me a striking
proof&mdash;I mean in my marriage. We were scarcely
friendly before that,&#8221; I added with a forced and somewhat
nervous laugh. &#8220;But I feel rather embarrassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a wife&#8217;s duty to obey her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally; but this marriage of ours was for
a special purpose, you see; and we were agreed
upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you care for your wife&#8217;s safety, to say nothing
of your own, you will take my advice, monsieur, and
leave the country with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all so unexpected.&#8221; I spoke in the manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
of one taken unawares. &#8220;I will take a day to consider
what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you must decide now,&#8221; he replied firmly;
thinking no doubt, as I intended he should, that I
wished to use the interval to get rid of the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a matter of such importance one must have
time,&#8221; I protested with a spice of indignation. &#8220;It
is only reasonable.&#8221; I was growing manifestly more
and more uneasy, and he perceived it. &#8220;It means
so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means&mdash;everything to you both, so far as your
future is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have time,&#8221; I repeated, and began to pace
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can grant none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does not rest with you to either grant or
refuse it,&#8221; I retorted, as if now attempting to put a
bolder face on things.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that, we shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was very confident; his voice and manner
showed that; and I am sure that he enjoyed my
apparent embarrassment. His sharp eyes followed
me as I strode up and down the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back this evening, and you shall have our
decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must know at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unreasonable, unjust, impossible,&#8221; I cried
with growing anger. &#8220;I will not stand your dictation
in such a matter. I can&#8217;t decide now, and I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not leave the room without your decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will;&#8221; and I walked to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>&#8220;You cannot leave, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned on him in time to catch a look of extreme
exultation in his eyes. He guessed I had the papers
on me and wished to get away with them. I promptly
rubbed it in by saying very angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not insult me, monsieur. If you wish
to make my wife a prisoner, you can do so; she will
remain; but you have no right to detain me. It is
monstrous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot leave the room, M. Denver; my men
are outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was now in great fear; the start I gave showed
him this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dare to make me, an American citizen,
a prisoner in my own rooms? You shall answer for
this, monsieur,&#8221; I exclaimed with great heat, and flung
the door open.</p>

<p>He had spoken truly. A half-dozen men were
stationed at the doors of our rooms. I shut the door
again angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall appeal to my Ambassador.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you not carried this far enough?&#8221; he asked
menacingly. I had come to the same conclusion&mdash;although
our reasons differed no doubt. &#8220;You have
no alternative now but to accept my conditions,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>I affected to think, and then called Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helga, Prince Kalkov orders us to leave Russia,
and because I will not consent immediately, and will
not advise you to take no further steps to clear your
father&#8217;s memory, he threatens to have us arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like his Highness,&#8221; she said contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What answer shall we give him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him do as he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Denver has not quite explained my position.
It is that you are free to leave Russia and go to the
United States, if you hand to me the papers of which
you obtained possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not make conditions with you, Prince Kalkov,&#8221;
answered Helga with splendid scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, madame. It is I who make them,
you who obey them,&#8221; he cried, rising, his voice trembling
with anger under the lash of her words and
look. &#8220;I will have no more of this; my patience is
exhausted. Will you give them up, monsieur, and
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not pretty in his anger, but I ventured on
one more little tonic for it. I burst into a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>&#8220;Oh, the papers you want? Why didn&#8217;t you say
so? I haven&#8217;t them; so I can&#8217;t give them to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is false, monsieur, it is false. You are lying!&#8221;
he exclaimed in a flame of passion, his eyes blazing.
Then his rage seemed to burst out like a long smouldering
volcano, which, breaking at length through the
thin restraining crust, pours out its flood of white hot
lava. &#8220;I know the truth. I have heard from your
Embassy. They were given to you to-day. I know
where you have been since. I have watched you here,
and I know they are upon your person now.&#8221; I started
back and, as if involuntarily, put my hand to my
breast pocket. He smiled cunningly. &#8220;Yes, I understand
that gesture. Come, monsieur, I have outplayed
you; give them me, and even now you can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your treacherous heart, Prince, you should
guard against such passion as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, monsieur,&#8221; he said, half beside himself
with anger. &#8220;Give them to me, give them to me!&#8221;
and he came toward me, his hand outstretched and
trembling violently. He looked the very incarnation of
triumphant and unbridled fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told your Highness I have not them,&#8221; I
said, drawing back.</p>

<p>I might as well have spoken to a whirlwind.</p>

<p>He answered me with a wild storm of invective,
cursing me for a liar and a villain and a hundred
other things, and ending with threats as unrestrained
as his anathemas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give them up and go. Go where you will, and
take your wife with you. We have no room even in
our gaols for either American scum like you or Nihilist
devils like her! Give them to me, I say. I have waited
and schemed for this triumph; and do you think I
will let you rob me of it? Give them me, give them
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner was so threatening that I half thought
he would throw himself on me and attempt to drag
the papers from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>&#8220;You are not yourself. You had better call your
men,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Helga, pale and shrinking before his outbreak, drew
behind me.</p>

<p>&#8220;By God! You dare to lie to me still!&#8221; he exclaimed,
and hurrying to the door, brought in a couple
of men. &#8220;Now, I give you a last chance. Will you
give them me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you I have nothing to give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The apparent obstinacy added fuel to his ungovernable
rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Search the dog,&#8221; he said savagely between his set
teeth; &#8220;and if he resists, use force.&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched me as the men approached, his eyes
scintillating with anger and his hands clenching and
unclenching with spasmodic tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not resist; I only protest, monsieur,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Search the dog!&#8221; he exclaimed again, his voice
choked with passion.</p>

<p>I made no resistance, of course; I had nothing to
gain by doing so; and when the men took from my
breast pocket the large envelope the Prince&#8217;s face
lighted with triumph, and rushing at the man who
held it, he tore it from his grasp, and then fell back
with it into a chair as if exhausted with the effort.</p>

<p>He gave one glance at the writing on the envelope
and looked up at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Liar! I knew it.&#8221; The growl of a beast gloating
over its prey secured after infinite labour&mdash;but secured.</p>

<p>While he was enjoying this moment of supposed
triumph over us, the men who had searched me stood
hesitating and waiting for further orders.</p>

<p>It was some moments before he could rally his
reserved strength and master his rage sufficiently to
speak to us again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even now I can be merciful. Will you go to
America?&#8221; He looked at us both and tapped one
of the packets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose, you&#8221;&mdash;and he pointed a trembling hand
at Helga&mdash;&#8220;between the mines and abandoning this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go to the mines&mdash;if you can send me
there,&#8221; she answered without a shade of hesitation.
Her quickness seemed to rekindle his rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man and woman are under arrest,&#8221; he said
to the men by me. &#8220;Remain outside the door.&#8221; As
they went out, he sat glaring at us and fingering the
packets.</p>

<p>&#8220;What next?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall answer for your crime, and may thank
your God I do not send you with your wife to the
mines at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t thank God; I thank my wife&#8217;s and my
precautions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dared to pit yourself against me; and can
see the result. Failure!&#8221; He all but hissed the word
at us as he shook the packet in triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you hold there is the proof of <i>your</i> failure,
not mine. You had better open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been so certain that for the moment he
only laughed; but on meeting my look, doubt and
anxiety began to steal over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers you seek are across the frontier; you
have nothing there but blank sheets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie, another damnable lie! I was at the
Embassy to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget; I was there and saw Mr. Marvyn&mdash;last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>

<p>His whole soul seemed to speak in that one cry
of dismay; and for a moment he looked at the packet
like a dazed man, afraid to open it and learn the truth.
Then with shaking frenzied fingers he tore at the seals.</p>

<p>Helga clung to my arm.</p>

<p>The paper was tough and resisted his efforts for
a time, thus accentuating his excitement and suspense.</p>

<p>At last he opened it and stared at the blank sheets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>Then he turned on me such a look of baffled rage
as I had never seen on a man&#8217;s face before.</p>

<p>He strove to speak, and failed; and the sheets
fluttered down to the ground from his nerveless
fingers.</p>

<p>Then he sprang up and staggered toward me, stopped
suddenly, uttered a loud inarticulate cry, and pressing
his hand to his heart, fell prone almost at my
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is ill,&#8221; said Helga, speaking for the first time,
and bending over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably dying,&#8221; I murmured; and seeing the
crisis, I went to the door and called his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince is very ill; you had better let some
one go for a doctor.&#8221;</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXXI</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">AT THE ELEVENTH
HOUR</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was instantly clear that we had to face a situation
fraught with many awkward complications.</p>

<p>We were under arrest by Prince Kalkov&#8217;s orders,
and his men left us in no doubt that both Helga
and I were suspected of having caused in some way
the sudden collapse.</p>

<p>Two of them stood by the doors to prevent our
leaving, and the others lifted the Prince and laid him
on a couch; and one of these three&mdash;he who had
searched me and appeared to be the chief of them&mdash;said
very curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sent for doctors and my chief; you will,
of course, remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean we are under arrest?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those were the Prince&#8217;s orders&mdash;before this
occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find he is suffering from heart trouble,
I expect; and pending the doctor&#8217;s arrival you had
better loose the clothes about his neck, open the window
to give him air, and let him take a glass of
brandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he has had some of that already,&#8221; he
returned, his eye falling on the empty glass. He
spoke with the knowing air of a man who suspects,
and he seized the glass and put it beyond my reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not forget I told you how to revive him, even
if you are such a fool as your words suggest,&#8221; I
answered contemptuously. &#8220;It was from that decanter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
there the brandy was poured; you had better
seize that as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctors were first to arrive, followed quickly
by a police official, and shortly after by Pierre, the
Prince&#8217;s confidential man.</p>

<p>The official spoke a few words to the doctors, and
then turned to me.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us he was a very different stamp
of man from his subordinate, and addressed me
courteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very embarrassing position, monsieur.
I understand that the Prince gave instructions for your
arrest and detention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are of course at your disposal. I would
first assure you that Prince Kalkov&#8217;s seizure is the
result of illness merely, for which we are in no way
responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to make a statement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. I am an American citizen, my name
is Harper C. Denver, and this lady is my wife. I
wish to go at once to the American Embassy&mdash;on
vitally urgent business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I cannot permit that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have also the honour to enjoy the friendship
of His Majesty the Emperor, as the Prince&#8217;s man
there, Pierre, can tell you. I was His Majesty&#8217;s guest
at the Palace recently.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was impressed by this; but after a moment&#8217;s
thought shook his head and repeated he could not
grant my request.</p>

<p>&#8220;My purpose in going there touches all this very
closely, and every moment of delay is important. May
I suggest that you put a question to the man Pierre,
to confirm what I told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew Pierre aside, and they spoke together a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get the real papers back by hook or
crook,&#8221; I whispered to Helga.</p>

<p>The official returned, looking very grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>&#8220;He tells me you were a Palace guest, monsieur,
but adds that for some days you and the Prince have
been on extremely hostile terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife will remain here, and I am quite content
that you and any number of your men should accompany
me. I assure you that my visit is of extreme
interest to his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought this over, and at length assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must accompany you, as you are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then. That is all I ask,&#8221; I broke in. &#8220;I
shall make no attempt to shirk any responsibility in
all this.&#8221;</p>

<p>We drove to the Embassy; he and one of his men
with me inside the carriage; and we were shown at
once to Marvyn, who looked in astonishment at my
companions, recognizing the chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am under arrest, Marvyn, that&#8217;s all. I am not
going to Siberia after all, and want you to stop those
papers. Wire to your man, wherever he is, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t gone yet. Something turned up to
delay him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then get back the packet and bring it along with
you to the Imperial, and just see to things. Prince
Kalkov was with us, and has had a seizure of some
sort, and my wife and I are under arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went away and returned soon, carrying the
packet.</p>

<p>&#8220;If those are M. Denver&#8217;s papers, I must ask that
they be given to me,&#8221; said the official immediately.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see for yourself that they bear the Embassy&#8217;s
seals, M. Drougoff, and are in my possession,&#8221;
replied Marvyn, with a readiness for which I blessed
him. &#8220;I am acting, of course, officially.&#8221;</p>

<p>We drove back to the hotel, and on the way I told
Marvyn pretty well how the case stood, withholding
for the moment, however, the fact that I had deceived
him in the morning.</p>

<p>The Prince had been removed from the room, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
Helga was alone there under guard. She was not
in the least disconcerted by the fresh development,
and had had tea served in anticipation of my return.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the charge against M. Denver, M.
Drougoff?&#8221; asked Marvyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the present I am not informed. Prince Kalkov
had ordered it; and there is now of course, the fact
of his Highness&#8217;s&mdash;seizure.&#8221; He hesitated for the
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will allow us to consult in private?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, M. Marvyn. I am indeed rather at a
loss what to do except that M. Denver must remain
under arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat down then to Helga&#8217;s tea-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must explain one thing,&#8221; I began at once. &#8220;I
misled you this morning about those papers. Those
are the real things&mdash;what I brought away with me
were shams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say&mdash;&#8221; he began, but I interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me a moment, and be angry afterwards
if you like. The liberty, and probably life, of us both
were at stake. Kalkov had planned to force the things
into my hands; and as soon as he thought you had
given them to me, he dogged every movement of mine
after leaving you this morning, and came here to get
them by force. All this pretence for a journey to
Siberia was just a lie; and we got wind of it in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no proofs, my dear fellow. I wished you
to be able to pass your word that you had given them
back to me&mdash;you did hand them me, remember, and
I gave them back under the different cover. I deceived
you intentionally, I know&mdash;but more than my
life was at stake,&#8221; and I glanced across to Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been a gravely compromising matter
for me, Denver,&#8221; he said, seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have taken the consequences of my act,
of course, and my father would have exhausted every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
resource to put things right. But you see now what
would have happened if I had had the papers here.
The dummies were taken from me by force, and I
was put under arrest; and my wife also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure Mr. Marvyn will see it as we do,&#8221; said
Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;And was it the discovery
of the&mdash;that he&#8217;d been tricked&mdash;caused this collapse?&#8221;
I nodded, and he whistled: &#8220;Phew, that&#8217;s
a circumstance. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing. I must see the Czar,
and you must hold on to those papers like grim death
till I can take them to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But with this indefinite charge hanging over
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, it&#8217;s got to be done; and done
at once, before the Prince gets up enough strength
to interfere. The Emperor will see me, I know; and
your people must arrange it. It&#8217;s absolutely essential.
I&#8217;m done, if I don&#8217;t get to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a most plausible reason for the audience,
Mr. Marvyn,&#8221; interposed Helga quickly. &#8220;His
Majesty will be most anxious to know at first hand
the facts about Prince Kalkov&#8217;s illness; and we alone
can tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid, Helga, splendid,&#8221; I said; and Marvyn
agreed. &#8220;Get my name to him somehow; any old
way&#8217;ll do; and I&#8217;ll answer for the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see about it at once,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;Meanwhile, what&#8217;s to happen to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Short of cutting our heads off, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; I
replied, as we rose. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that;&#8221; and
I hurried him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, M. Drougoff, we are at your disposal,&#8221; I
said to the police agent as soon as Marvyn had gone.
&#8220;What are you going to do with us? I may tell
you the American Embassy people are working energetically
in the affair, and I am sure to receive very
soon a summons to wait upon his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>&#8220;My people tell me that a very serious charge
is hanging over you both&mdash;I mean apart altogether
from this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell you wrong, then. My wife was charged
in some Nihilist practices and imprisoned by order
of Prince Kalkov; but the Prince himself ordered her
release from the prison last night, and was present
when she came away with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never been charged, and, as I say, was
with Prince Kalkov yesterday when my wife was
released.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very extraordinary complication. What
is behind it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a good deal behind, of course; but the
Prince himself can best explain it, when he is well
enough. At present I am only concerned to know
whether you wish to put us under lock and key. We
are quite ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was manifestly perplexed what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot release you, monsieur; you will see
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only for an hour or two at the worst,&#8221; and
I went back to the tea-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will send and inquire how the Prince is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a question whether he recovers in time to
stop the interview with the Czar,&#8221; said Helga to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he can&#8217;t stop it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few minutes the messenger returned, and
M. Drougoff crossed to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness is much better, monsieur; he is
rallying fast, and the doctors say that in an hour
probably, or at most two, I may be able to see him
and take instructions. In the meantime it will be most
convenient for matters to remain as they are. I do
not wish to trouble your charming wife and you
unnecessarily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I am much obliged to you,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;We can do nothing but wait,&#8221; I said to Helga, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
he had gone back to his seat. &#8220;Wait, that is, and
hope he won&#8217;t get well too soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he was worse,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish with all my heart he was,&#8221; I agreed.</p>

<p>Wishing was of no use, however; and there we
sat waiting for a time that seemed interminable, each
trying to prevent the other from seeing how real and
harassing was the anxiety of the suspense and each
conscious of, and smiling, at the other&#8217;s efforts.</p>

<p>Helga was very brave, very calm, and very cheerful;
and only in little signs and gestures&mdash;a start,
a glance, a movement of the features or hands&mdash;could
I see how the strain tried her.</p>

<p>Much less than an hour of this exhausted my patience,
however.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish whatever&#8217;s going to happen first would
happen and be done with it,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;I feel
like a man staked on a volcano top, uncertain whether
it&#8217;s going to explode and blow me up, or give way
and let me through into the lava.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d make a bad conspirator, Harper,&#8221; said
Helga, smiling. &#8220;They have to endure this kind of
thing for days, weeks and months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should manage it quicker in the States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those wonderful States again. Tell me a lot about
them. My new country,&#8221; she added sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no Kalkovs in them, for one thing, and&mdash;what&#8217;s
this, I wonder,&#8221; I broke off, as a man came
in and spoke to M. Drougoff.</p>

<p>It was nothing, or apparently nothing, for the man
went out again, and his superior sank again into the
condition of watchful inactivity, the result I concluded
of many years&#8217; training in spy work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to Heaven Marvyn would send us word
what&#8217;s doing. He might know one would be
anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can scarcely have done anything yet. He has
been gone barely an hour,&#8221; said Helga gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him he&#8217;d have to hustle.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>&#8220;But he does not know the Prince is getting better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t hurry up as if he did know it, he&#8217;s&mdash;well,
he&#8217;s an ass, and my father ought never to
have got him into the diplomatic service. Yes, laugh
away, I know I&#8217;m an idiot; but it helps a heap to
blame the other fellow;&#8221; and I laughed, too.</p>

<p>And so the minutes dragged until something did
happen.</p>

<p>Another message was brought to Drougoff, and this
time he got up and approached us.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince is well enough to receive me, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that,&#8221; I exclaimed, almost as
heartily as if he had told me we were both free.
Anything was better than suspense.</p>

<p>He went away, leaving the man to take his place.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is the Prince?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly recovered, monsieur. Weak, but that is
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s won the race, I&#8217;m afraid, Helga. We may
as well get ready. Where will he send us, I wonder.
We must manage somehow to leave word for Marvyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t let us do that. We must stop here to
the last possible moment. Think of everything you
can to use up time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you. You always have some good
notion.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Drougoff was not absent long, and looked very
troubled when he entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;My instructions are, I deeply regret to say, monsieur,
to remove you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>He named two different prisons.</p>

<p>&#8220;The charges?&#8221; I asked next.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not instructed to mention them, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am not going,&#8221; I said firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray consider, monsieur. Resistance will be quite
useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have considered, I assure you; and I shall resist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
If your instructions are to kill me or maim me,
you may obey them, if you wish. But I do not move
from here alive, and as I am a citizen of the United
States, my death may be a circumstance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me persuade you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can try if you like;&#8221; and try he did for over
a quarter of an hour of invaluable time, at the end of
which he was in despair, and I was as obdurate as
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Mr. Marvyn returns and advises me to go,
I&#8217;ll go; but until then I refuse point blank. You are
too courteous a man to make a good butcher, I am
sure, and I can put up an excellent fight at need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must obey my orders, monsieur,&#8221; he replied
tersely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as an American citizen, I refuse to budge
without knowing the charge against me, and until
my Embassy&#8217;s people are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am deeply sorry, but I have no alternative;&#8221;
and he rose.</p>

<p>Then Helga came to the rescue with a suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you not better return to the Prince with our
decision? My husband is a foreigner, and a friend of
His Majesty; and the situation is altogether unusual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless,&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; I said; &#8220;we&#8217;ll clear the decks.
I was getting ready for a long journey, monsieur, and
have arms here. If there is blood-shed, the responsibility
will not be mine. I am innocent of any offence,
and you may rely on it I will not be taken alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was very unexpected, I could see, and he
hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will acquaint his Highness,&#8221; he said after a
pause, and left us again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to fight, Harper,&#8221; asked Helga,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I. We&#8217;ve nothing to fight with,&#8221; I said,
smiling; &#8220;but we&#8217;ve gained twenty minutes and more.
I wish Marvyn would come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>&#8220;You took me in. I thought you were in earnest,&#8221;
she replied, in a tone of intense relief.</p>

<p>M. Drougoff was away longer than even I had
hoped; and when he returned he had a surprise
for us.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness himself is coming, monsieur,&#8221; he
announced, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that he can do any good, but that&#8217;s his
matter,&#8221; I said; and then we all stood in silence.</p>

<p>The shuffling of many feet was heard, the door was
thrown wide open, and the indomitable old man was
carried in lying on an improvised litter, with two
doctors at his side.</p>

<p>They set him down in the middle of the room, and
the bearers drew away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to see my orders obeyed,&#8221; he said,
with a glance at Drougoff, and then at Helga and
myself. His voice was weak, but his manner implacably
stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have come to see an ugly fight,&#8221; said I,
as firmly as though I meant resisting to the last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest them both, Drougoff. You have my authority
for using any force necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the charge against us?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your duty, you, Drougoff,&#8221; he said, viciously.</p>

<p>M. Drougoff signed to his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go forward, Helga. You can waste a little time
yet,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>She did splendidly again. She clung to me for a
moment as if overcome, and then with passionate distress
bade me good-bye.</p>

<p>The men held aloof during this; and when she went
to them she contrived very cleverly to get rid of a little
more time.</p>

<p>But the way was clear at length, and Drougoff
stepped towards me.</p>

<p>I drew back and put my hand in my pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come no further, monsieur, or your life
will be the forfeit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let your men fire if he resists,&#8221; said the relentless
old man.</p>

<p>Drougoff gave the necessary orders, and for a tense
moment I looked along the barrels of three levelled
revolvers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, monsieur,&#8221; said Drougoff.</p>

<p>I burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will. I have no firearms;&#8221; and I pulled
my empty hand from my pocket.</p>

<p>Then at last came the proof that I had not blustered
in vain.</p>

<p>Harold Marvyn came hurrying in, accompanied by
a man I recognized as the officer whom I had seen the
previous day in the ante-room of the Emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see your Highness is so far recovered,&#8221;
said Marvyn; &#8220;but what does this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That two dangerous Nihilists are on their way to
prison, monsieur,&#8221; came the reply, sharp and stern.</p>

<p>Marvyn&#8217;s indignation at the tone showed in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Emperor has commanded Mr. Denver&#8217;s immediate
presence at the Palace, your Highness. This
is an outrage upon an American citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Outrage or no outrage, they are going to prison,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Vilda,&#8221; said Marvyn, turning to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the Emperor&#8217;s commands, your Highness.
They are peremptory, and I must obey them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the woman?&#8221; The old bully&#8217;s tone was
worthy of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Denver is to accompany her husband to
the Palace, to be in readiness should his Majesty require
to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a dangerous Nihilist, Colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are his Majesty&#8217;s commands, your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your service, Colonel,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a carriage waiting, M. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>He offered his arm to Helga, and I followed with
Marvyn, and went out without even casting a glance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
at Kalkov; but I saw the two doctors bend over him
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had to hustle, Marvyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; he nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a near thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it looked.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that and a laugh of relief we got into the
carriage.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXXII</span>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE END</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HELGA was waiting for me with a look of eager
anxiety when I came out to her from my interview
with the Emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked, as she came to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is all well,&#8221; I answered smiling. &#8220;All
well, all the best it could be&mdash;for us. Not for the
Prince,&#8221; I added drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Justice will be done to his memory, my dear, full
justice. You were right in the kernel of your plans&mdash;to
get to the Czar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was certain of that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could have got to him all this would never
have happened. I never saw a man more moved. I
left all the papers with him and he&#8217;s going to study
them himself, and then see you. Never a breath of
the truth has ever been allowed to reach him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear father,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;At last,&#8221; and
she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Kalkov has had things his own way and has
had a fine past; but I don&#8217;t envy him his future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marvyn entered the ante-room then.</p>

<p>&#8220;How have things gone, Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have gone better, thanks to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By gorm, I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; he exclaimed with a sigh
of relief. &#8220;The ice was so thin I was afraid we
should be through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will bear every one except Kalkov, and it&#8217;ll put
his light out. You may gamble on that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>&#8220;It was a big risk to carry,&#8221; he said, thinking of
himself.</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have had half an hour of ours,&#8221; I
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he answered with a quaint smile.
&#8220;But one&#8217;s official responsibilities make such a difference,
Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but even unofficially one can have a sort of
sneaking regard for one&#8217;s life and liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never forget your help, Mr. Marvyn,&#8221; said
Helga, sweetly, as she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would take the risk again for such a smile, Mrs.
Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It&#8217;s very pretty
of you, but I hope we shan&#8217;t have to ask for it; although
we may still need the Embassy&#8217;s protection, if
the Emperor carries out his threats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to contemplate putting an end to Mrs.
Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harper?&#8221; cried Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true&mdash;as true as it is staggering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No spoke in the wheels I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>This from Marvyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;He threatens,&#8221; I said, looking very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are your eyes laughing, Harper?&#8221;
cried Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be no laughing matter if we find our marriage
annulled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only putting the riddle a different way;&#8221;
and Helga slipped her arm into mine and clasped her
hands on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Marvyn, seriously.</p>

<p>I had before observed his keen scent for trouble
from afar. The serious side of things always appealed
first to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He threatens,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we had enough problems lately?&#8221; and
Helga wrinkled her brows in half comical perplexity.
&#8220;But I can wait quite calmly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to make out that as the daughter of a
prince and his friend, you ought to be considered a
kind of Imperial ward to whose marriage his consent
was necessary; so that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Helga interrupted me with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it was nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that under the circumstances such a
claim could be maintained,&#8221; declared Marvyn gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And further that Helga cannot be Mrs. Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He talks about making reparation of everything
and giving you your father&#8217;s title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t be a Prince, surely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would of course be Princess,&#8221; said Marvyn,
in the same dry official manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Denver&#8217;s Princess! What an odd mixture!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be rather the Princess&#8217;s Mr.
Denver,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you say, Harper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that as to the material compensation we could
talk, but that about the title we&#8217;d go back to the hotel
and discuss it. Will you come with us, Marvyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>He excused himself on the plea of business and left
us, and Helga and I were just going when Colonel
Vilda came to summon her to an audience with the
Emperor. She was to go alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you, Mr. Denver,&#8221; he said to
me when he returned from ushering her into the
presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing that to myself very heartily,
Colonel, I can assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess will make a brilliant figure in the
Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which Princess, Colonel, and which Court?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess Lavalski,&#8221; he answered, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>&#8220;We have no Court in the States, Colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not take her from us in the very
moment of our finding her again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve managed to get along pretty well without
her so far, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear monsieur! She&#8217;s so charming,
so beautiful, so wealthy&mdash;the world will be at her
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll have to be the western hemisphere of it then,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but it would be a crime to take her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t take her away, Colonel&mdash;but somehow I
have an idea she won&#8217;t much care to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is too bad;&#8221; and he laughed and spread
his hands.</p>

<p>There came a little commotion at the door then, and
when it was opened, Prince Kalkov was carried in
seated in a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let His Majesty know that I crave an immediate
audience with him, Colonel Vilda, on urgent matters
of State,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty is engaged, your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am accustomed to be obeyed, Colonel Vilda,&#8221;
returned Kalkov austerely.</p>

<p>The Colonel drew himself up at the tone, paused
and then bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take your Highness&#8217; message,&#8221; he said, and
left us.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen the Emperor, monsieur?&#8221; said
the Prince to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What passed between you?&#8221; he demanded, with
much of his customary arrogant insistence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a confidential interview, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it concerned me I have a right to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you to excuse my saying anything.
You and I began as friends, then we had a pretty
sharp burst as antagonists; now if you please we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
must be neutrals&mdash;I have nothing further to say to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have yet to see his Majesty, monsieur.&#8221; Even
now he was ready to threaten me in his indomitable
doggedness.</p>

<p>I took no notice, and presently Colonel Vilda returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty is unable to see your Highness,&#8221; he
announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not take that answer,&#8221; declared the Prince
vehemently. &#8220;The matters are too urgent and vitally
affect his Majesty himself, for me to take it. I have
been his loyal adviser and faithful minister for many
years. I am not to be thrown aside on the bare word
of hirelings and traitors.&#8221; He was fast losing self-control
in his passion when he checked himself and
said: &#8220;Give my humble greetings to his Majesty, tell
him I am ill and perhaps dying, and solicit most earnestly
that he will see me. Say it may be the last time
on earth I may ever speak to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty was very decided,&#8221; said the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty does not know either how ill I am
or how urgent my business. Should I be here like
this, if it were not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Vilda went in again and this time the interval
before his return passed in silence.</p>

<p>When he returned, Helga was with him. I saw she
had been weeping and that the tears were still in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are tears of joy and gratitude, Harper,&#8221; she
whispered, taking my arm and then started as she saw
Prince Kalkov.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty deeply regrets to hear of your Highness&#8217;s
illness,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;and he counsels your
immediate return to your house, where he will communicate
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man listened with frowning brows and unmoved
firmness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not true,&#8221; he declared doggedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>&#8220;It is as I say, your Highness; and his Majesty
further bids me say that as your health has broken
down, he will immediately relieve you of all your official
duties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He cannot mean this&mdash;and without ever seeing
me,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty is too overcome by news which has
reached him to-day, to be able to endure the strain of
an interview with your Highness, and has retired to
his private apartments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God! after all my years of service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Harper,&#8221; whispered Helga; and we hurried
out glad to escape the sight of our enemy&#8217;s
overthrow.</p>

<p>On the way to the hotel she told me all the Emperor
had said to her; the regrets he had expressed; the
sorrow he felt; the promises he made; and the hopes
he had expressed for her future happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a Princess?&#8221; I asked; &#8220;or as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced and smiled and ran on into the hotel,
leaving me unanswered.</p>

<p>At the hotel Ivan was waiting, anxious concerning
our journey to Siberia, and overjoyed at seeing us
together again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has your Highness any commands?&#8221; I asked
Helga.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, has Mrs. Denver any wishes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not going to Siberia, Ivan,&#8221; she said to
him. &#8220;Everything has come right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great burly fellow laughed with the delight of
a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could cry with pleasure, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, that&#8217;s still a third title for you&mdash;mademoiselle,&#8221;
I laughed.</p>

<p>She would not hear me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are going on a long journey, Ivan, all the
same,&#8221; she said, in a very matter of fact unconcerned
tone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_326.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="allsmcap">WE HURRIED OUT GLAD TO ESCAPE THE SIGHT OF OUR<br />
ENEMY&#8217;S OVERTHROW.</span>&#8221;&mdash;<a href="#Page_326"><i>Page 326.</i></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To New York, of course; where else should Mrs.
Denver go, indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you,&#8221; I cried and then&mdash;but Ivan was
in the room; so I turned him out first and told him
to go and pack, as we should start as soon as possible.</p>

<p>And we did.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph2">Good Fiction Worth Reading.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">A series of romances containing several of the old favorites in the field
of historical fiction, replete with powerful romances of love and diplomacy
that excel in thrilling and absorbing interest.</p></div>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><b>GUY FAWKES.</b> A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The &#8220;Gunpowder Plot&#8221; was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p></div>


<p><b>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.</b> A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth. 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A book rather out of the ordinary is this &#8220;Spirit of the Border.&#8221; The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>

<p>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian &#8220;Village
of Peace&#8221; are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>

<p>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>

<p>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p></div>


<p><b>RICHELIEU.</b> A tale of France in the reign of King Louis XIII. By G. P.
R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>

<p>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal&#8217;s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar&#8217;s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the state-craft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p></div>


<p><b>WINDSOR CASTLE.</b> A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Windsor Castle&#8221; is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. &#8220;Bluff King Hal,&#8221; although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King&#8217;s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p></div>


<p><b>HORSESHOE ROBINSON.</b> A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>

<p>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>

<p>Take it all in all, &#8220;Horseshoe Robinson&#8221; is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p></div>


<p><b>THE PEARL OF ORR&#8217;S ISLAND.</b> A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Written prior to 1862, the &#8220;Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island&#8221; is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the &#8220;sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr&#8217;s Island,&#8221; and straightway
comes &#8220;the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel&#8217;s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in &#8220;The Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island.&#8221;</p></div>


<p><b>A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE.</b> A story of American Colonial Times. By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p></div>


<p><b>THE TOWER OF LONDON.</b> A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This romance of the &#8220;Tower of London&#8221; depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader
in the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.</p></div>


<p><b>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING.</b> A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p></div>


<p><b>GARTHOWEN.</b> A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character&mdash;the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.&#8221;&mdash;Detroit Free
Press.</p></div>


<p><b>MIFANWY.</b> The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.&#8221;&mdash;Boston Herald.</p></div>


<p><b>DARNLEY.</b> A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In point of publication, &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is that work by Mr. James which
follows &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that &#8220;Darnley&#8221; came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.</p>

<p>As a historical romance &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>

<p>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic &#8220;field of the cloth of
gold&#8221; would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>

<p>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p></div>


<p><b>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE.</b> By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U. S. N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
&#8220;who go down in ships&#8221; been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>

<p>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is &#8220;Captain Brand,&#8221;
who, as the author states on his title page, was a &#8220;pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.&#8221; As a sea story pure and simple, &#8220;Captain Brand&#8221; has
never been excelled, and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p></div>


<p><b>NICK OF THE WOODS.</b> A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
&#8220;Nick of the Woods&#8221; will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird&#8217;s clever and versatile pen.</p></div>
